## The question

M8.4 P1A established that the imaginary parts in the computed bundle spectra belong to the
assembled matrix rather than to the eigensolver: holding `L_h` byte-for-byte fixed, they are
unchanged from float64 through 50-digit arithmetic
([P1A closeout](../findings/m8_4_p1a_closeout.md)). It did not establish which upstream stage
produces them. M8.9 asks exactly that, and nothing else:

> does the non-real spectrum enter through the base RBF-FD discretization, through the equivariant
> quotient assembly, or through their interaction?

The shipped contamination table cannot answer it, because each nontrivial bundle was inspected only
at its own first-section level, so `rho`, `d_rho` and `lambda = d_rho(d_rho + 2)` move together
across every row. "High harmonic level is hard for this discretization" and "nontrivial fibre
transport manufactures the complex part" fit the same numbers.

## Stages

**S1, trivial-fibre high-level control.** The trivial bundle `R_0` supplies the missing cell, a
trivial fibre at high harmonic level. Its production block is exactly 60x60 at 60 seeds and the
2I-invariant harmonics fill it exactly, multiplicities 1, 13, 21, 25 at `lambda = 0, 168, 440, 624`.
P1A examined only the `lambda = 0` cluster. Governed by
[the filed S1 decision rule](../findings/m8_9_s1_decision_rule.md), frozen and hashed before any S1
spectrum was computed. S1 is a control, not a verdict: its job is to decide whether S2 is needed.

**S2, independent restriction, if S1 does not settle it.** Compare the production quotient
transport assembly against an independent subspace restriction of the cover-space operator, on the
same cloud with the same RBF weights. Scope and the `R_1` pre-commitment are in the same filed rule.

## Why a new identity rather than an M8.4 row

The [#468](https://github.com/openwave-labs/openwave/pull/468) merge commitment records that any
continuation is separately commissioned substrate work rather than a P1A repair, and that future M8
reviews enforce that boundary. A row numbered inside M8.4 would read as reopening the phase by
placement even though its text says otherwise. M8.4 keeps its `pilot BLOCKED` status unchanged.

## Boundaries

No M8.4 thresholds, no amplitude ladder, no label calibration, no nonlinear run on any bundle, no
target sector spent. M8.9 reads a spectrum that already exists in shipped code and classifies it
under a rule frozen in advance.

## S1 RESULT (2026-08-25): INSTRUMENT DEFECT

S1 ran under the filed rule with its freeze verified first. **G-MULT failed**, so no S1-A/B/C
classification was issued and `I_star` was not formed. The `R_0` production block at 60 seeds does
not reproduce the analytic decomposition the rule predicted. Stated in the frozen assignment
windows, since G-MULT's failure is precisely the statement that level identities are NOT
established: the `C_20` window holds 20 against a required 21 and spans 347.7 to 530.3, the `C_24`
window holds 26 against 25 and spans 549.7 to 1319.0 where the block's analytic content stops at
624, and complex-conjugate pairs appear already within the `C_12` window. The lowest mode stays
clean at 5.954e-14 and matches the shipped P1A value.

**No high-level localization conclusion is licensed, including from the apparently dirty `C_12`
window.** `C_12` returned its exact count of 13 with `max|Im|` of 3.035, recorded as a
non-adjudicative observation from an instrument-failed run and not read as S1-A:
count-only safety is not subspace correctness, and the filed rule requires all four counts so that
a partially-resolved spectrum cannot be mined for the branch its cleanest window supports.

S1-B and S1-C route to S2; an instrument defect does not, so **S1 does not trigger S2** and M8.9's
question is unanswered. Record: [`../m8_9/s1_note.md`](../m8_9/s1_note.md),
reproducer [`../m8_9/s1_run.py`](../m8_9/s1_run.py).

## S1b RESULT (2026-08-26): ADJUDICATED `S1b-SPECTRAL`

S1 closed `INSTRUMENT DEFECT` because the global spectrum could not sort itself into continuum
levels. **S1b removed that assumption**, constructing the invariant subspaces independently of `L`
by two algebraically different routes, sampling them on the production cloud, and asking the shipped
operator what it does to them. The non-real action was still there and still enormous: `J = 2.201`
at `n = 12` and `J = 19.254` at `n = 20`, stable to thirteen figures at `n = 12` and fourteen at
`n = 20` across the three precision rungs, and to eight and nine figures respectively across the
two constructions. Separately, `‖K_n‖_2` clears `K_floor` by 5.3e+06 at `n = 12` and
6.5e+07 at `n = 20`.

**Licensed, and no more:** the trivial fibre alone can produce a non-real compressed action, so
nontrivial fibre transport is NOT NECESSARY, and the base discretization or the scalar quotient
reduction is strongly implicated. **That disjunction is not resolved.** S1b excluded a candidate; it
did not separate the remaining two.

**S2 is NOT triggered.** The frozen routing sends `S1b-ADJOINT` and `S1b-NULL` to a possible
reduction-mechanism comparison; SPECTRAL is not routed there, the rule is SILENT on its
disposition, and the closeout closes M8.9 at its claim ceiling on its own authority. No further
stage is commissioned.

**The qualification run that produced these numbers was NONCONFORMING**, having evaluated the live
target it was forbidden to touch, under a contract that never drew the line between forming `A_n`
for the gates and evaluating `K_n` and `J_n`. The measurements were retained rather than voided
because every interpreting rule was frozen and hash-published beforehand, and the branch was issued
by a separate adjudication unit with no computational authority. Full account, chain of custody and
