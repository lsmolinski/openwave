## TASK PLANNING (author-proposed; registration and go pending)

### The question

The fourth bedrock paper, verified blind under M8.1.2, stops at the leading reduced problem. Its critical rays "are then the critical directions of the leading reduced problem, and not solution branches: an actual branch requires the range equation described in Section 6.2, which is not carried out." This task carries the range equation one order, at the four critical rays of the paper's § 5.8 (coherent `v_3`, zonal `v_0`, octahedron, hexagon) in the sectors `3′` and `4`: eight formal branch expansions. It computes the first correction `ξ` to the state and the next coefficient `λ₄` of the eigenvalue, and checks that each ray persists at that order. It establishes no branch.

### Standing: the #512 ruling

| Point | Ruling |
| --- | --- |
| Run-before-write | M8.1.2 meets the first condition; nothing else needs to land first |
| Identity | a new identity, M8.10, filed as a BACKLOG row with its task doc in the PR that carries the pre-registration; not an M8.1.x sub-ID, since the range equation is work the paper names and does not do |
| Budget | one pre-registration within the § 12.2 budget of about 8,000 words; nothing further lands on it until it has run |
| Defect claims | a claim that this frozen text is defective is reproduced by the maintainer with independent code before it is ratified |
| Solver side | the pre-registration states which side of the closed spectral route its solver is on |
| The law | derived and pinned here, starting from nothing in `m8_5c/design_inputs/`, whose `jacobian_check.py` carries the global law ([#508](https://github.com/openwave-labs/openwave/issues/508)) |

### Which side of the closed spectral route

The analytic side, to a stated order: the state to order `a³` and the eigenvalue to order `a⁴`. Everything is finite algebra in the sectors' harmonics: Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and averages over the 120 elements of the group. There is no truncation, because the cubic of a level-6 state has no content above level 18 and every sum is finite; no continuation, no time-stepping and no quadrature; and no code or data from the C rooms. What separates this from the chassis gate 7 was built for is the equation being solved: never the nonlinear equation at finite amplitude, only the linear equations of successive orders.

### What this task is not

Not branches at finite amplitude, existence or stability. Not slot selection: the sectors are chosen, not selected. Nothing about OQ1, the stress tensor or the metric. It is not an in-platform field-dynamics validation for [M8.7](m8_7_task_details.md) and neither satisfies nor weakens that gate; the M8.7 gate-line correction filed with this task is bookkeeping and leaves the condition unchanged.

### Ownership and run format

The author supplies candidate values from a fresh derivation and an offered instrument, and then stops; the designer may edit the claims and freezes them at go. The recommended run follows M8.1.2's format: two blind agents with separate implementations, an adversarial audit that commits its own method first, then the designer's comparison against the frozen claims. The author has seen the September estimates and all eight fresh values, and the author's package shares one convention stack, so only separate blind implementations can tell a convention reproducing itself from independent recovery. The format is the designer's to set, and the label follows it: two blind agents and an audit earn blind, and a single maintainer reproduction earns [independent-method reproduction](../m8_roadmap.md#conventions).

## THE LAW, DERIVED AND PINNED

| Step | Statement |
| --- | --- |
| (a) Engine | `v_mode 1` (`cubic_nls`): `V = (c1/4)u²` and `dV = c1·u·ψ` with `u = ψ·ψ`, on one real three-component field, evolved by `∂²ψ/∂t² = c²∇²ψ − dV(ψ)`. The engine leaves the sign of `c1` to the caller ("For a focusing (attractive) potential, use c1 < 0") |
| (b) Modeling extension, called that | the engine's real inner product `ψ·ψ` becomes the Hermitian `ψ†ψ` on sections of the flat unitary bundle `E_σ` over `X = S³/2I`, so `V = (g/4)(ψ†ψ)²`, with the Laplacian of `X` in place of the engine's `∇²`. The complexification lives here, not in step (c). Gradients are taken with respect to the underlying real Hilbert metric, for which `V` has gradient `g(ψ†ψ)ψ`; the Wirtinger derivative `∂V/∂ψ̄` is half of that. The engine's bytes supply the local form, not `3′` or `4` sections |
| (c) Reduction | with `ψ = e^{iωt}φ`, the PDE of (a) under (b) gives `(−c²Δ − ω²)φ + g(φ†φ)φ = 0`, which is the paper's § 2.5 equation with `c = 1`, `λ = ω²` and `g = c1` |

Every value is stated per power of `g`, which covers both signs.

## SETTING AND DERIVATION (equations first)

**Setting.** `(−Δ − λ)ψ + g|ψ|²ψ = 0` on sections of `E_σ`, `σ ∈ {3′, 4}`, with `R = 1` and the paper's normalized Haar measure (`∫_X 1 = 1`), the conventions under which the paper's `Q_d` and M8.1.2's values hold. Level `n` has `−Δ` eigenvalue `n(n+2)`. The kernel `K` is the seven-dimensional level-6 block. A fibre ray `v ∈ V_3` lifts to a block section `Φ = Φ_{σ,v}`, normalized by `∫_X |Φ|² = 1`; the paper's remark after Corollary 5.6 warns that normalizing the fibre instead gives a different coefficient, so every value is stated for `Φ`.

**Notation, fixed against the paper's.** `N(ψ) = |ψ|²ψ` is the pointwise cubic (the paper's `𝓝` is its block projection). `Π_K`, `Π_⊥ = I − Π_K` and `Π_n` project onto the block, its complement and level `n`. `A = −Δ − 48`, inverted on the range of `Π_⊥`. The first correction is `ξ`. The paper's `χ` (a stabilizer character), its `P = ηη†` and its `Π_{u⊥}` (a projector inside the fibre) keep their own meanings and are not used here.

**Expansion.** `ψ = aΦ + a³ξ + O(a⁵)` and `λ = 48 + λ₂a² + λ₄a⁴ + O(a⁶)`, with `a > 0`, the phase fixed so that `⟨Φ, ψ⟩` is real, and `Π_K ξ = 0`. At order `a³`, `Aξ − λ₂Φ + gN(Φ) = 0`. Its block part gives `λ₂ = g·Q_d([v])`, since at a critical ray `Π_K N(Φ) = Q_d Φ` (Corollary 5.6); its range part gives `ξ = −g A⁻¹ f` with `f = Π_⊥ N(Φ)`. At order `a⁵`, pairing with `Φ` gives `λ₄ = g⟨Φ, DN_Φ[ξ]⟩`. With `DN_Φ[h] = 2 Re(Φ†h) Φ + |Φ|² h`, the pairing is `2X + X̄` with `X = ⟨N(Φ), ξ⟩ = −g⟨f, A⁻¹f⟩`, which is real, so

`λ₄ = −3g² ⟨f, A⁻¹f⟩ = −3g² Σ_n ‖Π_n N(Φ)‖² / (n(n+2) − 48)`,

summed over the sector's levels above 6. Both `‖Π_n ξ‖² = g² ‖Π_n N(Φ)‖² / (n(n+2) − 48)²` and `λ₄` are therefore fixed by the level norms of one cubic.

**Strict sign.** Above level 6 every denominator is positive and every summand nonnegative, so `λ₄ ≤ 0`. At least one summand is nonzero. If `f = 0`, then `N(Φ) = Q_d Φ` pointwise, so `|Φ|²` takes only the values `0` and `Q_d`; being continuous on the connected `X`, it is constant, and the normalization makes it 1, forcing `Q_d = 1`. But `Q_d = 1 + w₆(d) r̂₆` with `w₆(d) > 0`, and `r̂₆ = ‖ρ₆‖²/‖v‖⁴`, the normalized top multipole, is nonzero at all four rays. So `λ₄ < 0` whenever `g ≠ 0`.

**Persistence at the four rays.** By Lemma 5.3, the stabilizer `H` of each ray acts on `Φ` by a character whose isotypic space in the block is one-dimensional. `N`, `Π_K`, `Π_⊥` and `A⁻¹` all commute with `H`, so `f` and `ξ` carry the same character as `Φ`, and `Π_K DN_Φ[ξ]` lies in `ℂΦ`. The order-`a⁵` block equation therefore has no component orthogonal to `Φ`, and no kernel correction `a³v` with `v ⊥ Φ` is needed. The two further critical rays of Lemma 5.3(b), the pentagonal pyramid and the trigonal prism on the `D₃` locus, each lie on a fixed locus of dimension one. There the argument fails and the direction can move at the next order, which is why they are out of scope; claim D2 checks it at the pentagonal pyramid.

**Levels.** From the 2I characters, the sectors occupy different levels: `3′` at 6, 10, 14, 16 and 18, and `4` at 6, 8, 12, 14, 16 and 18, each once except level 18 in sector 4, which occurs twice (`Hom_2I(4, V_9)` is two-dimensional). A reproduction must project onto the whole two-copy space there, because the one-copy Schur reduction used at level 6 is unavailable.

**Why some levels vanish.** `Π_n N(Φ)` carries the character of `Φ`'s stabilizer, so its fibre factor lies in that character's isotypic part of `V_{n/2}`, and a level vanishes identically where that part is zero. Three rules follow. At the zonal ray (stabilizer `O(2)`, character `−1` on the flip), level `n` vanishes exactly when `n ≡ 0 (mod 4)`. At the octahedron (the `A₂` character of the octahedral rotation group), level `n` vanishes exactly when `A₂` is absent from `V_{n/2}`, which in range is `n = 8, 10, 16`. At the coherent ray (`U(1)`), no level vanishes. The hexagon's stabilizer, dihedral of order 12, forces nothing in range. Level 16 has a second cause, common to the three time-reversal-invariant rays: with `Θv = λv`, the spin-8 channel `[ρ₆(v) ⊗ v]_8` that carries level 16 (the paper's § 5.7 and Proposition 3.3) becomes `λ[[v ⊗ v]_6 ⊗ v]_8`, a holomorphic cubic, which factors through `Sym³V_3` and vanishes because `Sym³V_3` contains no `V_8` (M8.1.2's A1). At the zonal and octahedron rays the stabilizer forces the same zero independently.

## THE FIREWALL

The requirements follow M8.1.2's; containment and roles are the designer's to fix at go.

| Requirement | Statement |
| --- | --- |
| Repository and paper | solver and audit contexts have no access to the OpenWave M8 tree, the `mode-identity-theory` repository, the deposited paper, or M8.1.2's records |
| Network | no unrestricted web search; any external reference is a generic representation-theory or computer-algebra source approved in advance by the designer |
| Manifest | each agent returns a consulted-material manifest; an empty or unreturned manifest is a protocol failure |
| Audit ordering | the auditor commits its own method and results before it sees the solver's work |
| Group presentation | the group is given by two generating unit quaternions, not by name, and the packet check X0 runs before any claim |

**Where the frozen values live.** In this file, which is an explicit answer key, so the leak path of record is this file and not the handout. At go the designer states where it is held and what prevents a solver session from reading that path.

**Withheld terms.** The author, the model, the repositories, the paper's title, "surviving ray", every frozen value and every claim ID. Permitted: the vocabulary the problem needs, including the four rays as explicit fibre vectors.

**Designer-only material: the author's package.** The fresh derivation's code, `RESULTS.md` (the candidate values with their provenance, regenerated by one command), a post-derivation note recording an observation made after the values were known, which is not claimed here, and the record of the dry run described under instrument qualification. None of it reaches an agent. The designer adjudicates against the frozen claims first and opens the package only afterwards, for provenance comparison. Agreement between the package and the agents is weak evidence, since a shared convention error survives it; disagreement is strong evidence that something is wrong. The package lands in the repository after the verdict, under `research/scripts/m8_10_author/`, byte-identical to these hashes:

**Offered instrument (adopt, modify, or discard).** [`../m8_10/worklist.md`](../m8_10/worklist.md): the conventions and a worklist, carrying the definitions and none of the results. It is the only file a solver receives. Before the room opens, the designer audits it against the frozen claims independently; the author's own review of it is not evidence of non-leakage. The worklist labels the rays `R1` to `R5`: `v_3`, `v_0`, `v_2 + v_−2` and `v_3 + v_−3` (the coherent, zonal, octahedron and hexagon rays, unnormalized), and the pentagonal pyramid. Coverage, for the designer to confirm rather than take from this sentence: items 2 and 3 reach A1 and A2; item 1 reaches B1, whose level-6 row the handout's § 1.4 supplies, so B1 is graded from level 8 up; items 4 and 5 reach B2, B3a and B3b; items 7 and 8 reach Group C; item 6 reaches Group D, with `R5` as D2's negative control; and items 0 and 9 reach X0 and X4.

## DISCLOSURE

**Exploratory runs before this task (2026-08-31 and 2026-09-01).** Local runs followed the hexagon branch in both sectors by Newton continuation in a truncated harmonic basis (levels up to 18, and in sector 4 also up to 30). They ran on the preserved C2 room's code (fifteen modules byte-identical to `m8_5c2/a1/in_room_as_edited/` on `main`, plus an empty package marker) with a script-local pointwise Jacobian: the room's `real_jacobian` was never reached and nothing in `m8_5c/design_inputs/` was imported. With `g = 1` they returned `λ₂ = 1.202360` (sector `4`) and `1.359751` (sector `3′`), equal to the paper's `Q_d` at the hexagon; `‖ξ‖ = 7.142118×10⁻³` and `3.602677×10⁻³`; and `(λ − 48 − λ₂a²)/a⁴ = −5.852×10⁻³` and `−4.186×10⁻³` at `a = 0.1`, the smallest amplitude, with `a` the solution's norm. The fresh derivation reproduces both `‖ξ‖` values to `8×10⁻⁸` relative and both `λ₄` readings to within `2×10⁻⁴` relative, the size of the `O(a²)` offset at `a = 0.1`.

**The derivation.** Author-side, carried out by the author and the author's AI agents, in a folder that imports numpy, scipy, mpmath and its own modules only: nothing from the rooms, the design inputs or the September scripts. It is fresh but not blind, since it was written with the September numbers known. Two author-side review units redlined the outline and then the derivation, three rounds each; that review is not verification. The worklist was also dry-run once before proposal by a fresh author-side context; see [instrument qualification](#instrument-qualification-2026-09-12).

## CANDIDATE PRE-REGISTERED CLAIMS

Frozen by the designer at go, not by the author. Conventions as in the setting above. Tabulated values are `λ₂/g`, `‖Π_n ξ‖²/g²` and `λ₄/g²`, so no sign of `g` is assumed.

**Status of the values: candidate exact rationals.** Each level norm `‖Π_n N(Φ)‖²` was computed by finite algebra in 60- and 100-digit arithmetic and identified as a rational with denominator at most `10¹⁶`. The two precisions give identical fractions; the worst residual at 100 digits is 2.57e-100, and the largest identified denominator is 237,562,624. The level norms need not be rational a priori, since the sector projectors involve the golden ratio, so their rationality is itself a finding. Conditional on those identified fractions, the `λ₄` and `‖ξ‖²` fractions follow by exact rational arithmetic. This is rational identification, not a symbolic derivation; a blind agent that derives the fractions symbolically promotes them to exact results at adjudication.

| C3 | no common sector multiplier: the four ratios `λ₄(3′)/λ₄(4)` are pairwise distinct, whereas at leading order `(λ₂(3′) − g)/(λ₂(4) − g) = w₆(3)/w₆(4) = 16/9` at every ray | the four ratios reproduced | any ratio differs, or two coincide |

### Group D: persistence, with one negative control

| ID | Claim | Pass condition | Fail condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | at the four rays, `Π_K DN_Φ[ξ]` lies in `ℂΦ`, and `⟨Φ, DN_Φ[ξ]⟩/g`, computed directly rather than through the level sum, is real and equals C1's `λ₄/g²` (equivalently, `g⟨Φ, DN_Φ[ξ]⟩ = λ₄`) | the component orthogonal to `Φ` vanishes at all eight, by the stabilizer argument or to a stated precision, and the direct pairing returns C1 | a nonzero orthogonal component, or a mismatch |
| D2 (negative control) | at `R5`, the pentagonal pyramid of Lemma 5.3(b) (`v = cos t·v_2 + sin t·v_−3`, `sin²t = 12/25`), the component of `Π_K DN_Φ[ξ]` orthogonal to `Φ` is nonzero in both sectors, so the fixed-ray expansion fails there and no `λ₄` is defined for it; the worklist asks at `R5` only for that component | nonzero in both sectors | zero in either |

### Diagnostics (not claims)

| ID | What it detects |
| --- | --- |
| X0 (packet check, before solving) | the two quaternions are units and generate a perfect group of order 120, as in M8.1.2 |
| X1 (normalization) | normalizing the fibre, `‖v‖ = 1`, instead of the section, `∫_X \|Φ\|² = 1`, scales `λ₂` by `d/7`, the artifact the paper's remark after Corollary 5.6 describes, and every later value moves with it |
| X2 (gradient convention) | taking the Wirtinger derivative as the force halves `g`, which halves `λ₂` and quarters `λ₄` |
| X3 (the level-18 plane) | a one-copy Schur scalar reused at level 18 in sector `4` misses part of that level's norm |
| X4 (range equation) | `Π_⊥(Aξ + gN(Φ)) = 0` checked coefficient by coefficient, with `A` applied through the SU(2) Casimir rather than the eigenvalue table, so that a mislabeled level fails it |

### Feasibility, stated honestly

Most claims are finite evaluations. Two are not spot checks: C2 is a sign argument, not eight signs, and B3b needs each ray's stabilizer and its character, or time reversal at level 16. The dry run reached only the zonal arguments, so a B3b failure in the real run would be a legitimate outcome, not a defect of the packet. Exact reproduction may come from symbolic algebra or from rational identification at a precision and denominator bound the agent states.

### Instrument qualification (2026-09-12)

Before proposal, the worklist was run once by a fresh author-side context: a headless Claude session (Opus 4.6), the author's AI agent, in a room outside every repository holding only the worklist and a short brief. Web tools were disabled and reads of the answer locations denied; a canary run showed nothing answer-bearing loaded at startup, and the transcript audit found no call outside the room in 55 tool calls. The run took 2 h 7 min. The mechanical comparison against the frozen values was 103 comparisons with no discrepancy: the level multiplicities (ten rows, the level-18 multiplicity included), the eight `λ₂/g` (and `R5`'s two against the paper's `r̂₆`), all 36 per-level norms of `ξ` and of the cubic with their zeros, the eight `λ₄/g²` and the four ratios. It also reported the expected qualitative behavior at `R5`, a nonzero orthogonal component and no `λ₄` defined there, without being told that `R5` was a control. This is not a verification: the agent is the author's, and the author wrote the instrument. Four repairs followed, and no expected value changed.

| change | why |
| --- | --- |
| item 2 asks for exact coefficients through the `M_K` | the agent gave C3's coefficients to four digits, exact only in a basis of its own |
| item 9 requires the Casimir to be built and applied | the agent substituted `n(n+2)` and reported the resulting tautology as the check |
| B3 split into the census (B3a) and the arguments (B3b) | the census reproduced exactly, but only the zonal zeros at levels 8 and 12 got exact arguments; level 16 was reduced to one channel and then checked numerically, and the octahedron zeros were checked numerically and put down to an accident. The split separates a census from a derivation that proved to differ in difficulty; B3b's bar is unchanged, since an unresolved report still fails |
| C2's pass condition states what counts for strictness | the agent derived nonnegativity from the structure and strictness from exact nonzero entries, which the old wording left unclear |

The run used the worklist with SHA-256 `b08d23c6ceba1ba18cc9ba53b3801d3654e11f495c4b9945e97e353692348248`; items 2 and 9 were reworded after it. Its brief, return and transcript are in the author's package.

### To be fixed at go (before numerics)

| Item | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Claims frozen | the designer freezes the tables above, edited freely, before any solver launches |
| Answer-key containment | where this file is held, and what prevents a solver reading it |
| Instrument | adopt the offered worklist after confirming it reaches every claim, modify it, or build a fresh one |
| Handout audit | maintainer-side and independent of the author's review |
| Run format | two blind agents and an audit (recommended; earns blind), or a single maintainer reproduction (earns independent-method reproduction) |
| Exactness rule | what counts as exact reproduction: symbolic derivation, or rational identification at a stated precision and bound |

### Definition of done (skeleton, finalized at go)

| # | Item |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Solver and auditor returns, scripts and data in the repository with `m8_10_` prefixes |
| 2 | Adversarial audit with its own method, per-claim verdicts, and a hunt for checks that cannot fail |
| 3 | Designer comparison against the frozen claims, every number stated; diagnostics recorded apart from the verdicts |
| 4 | Transcript audit of every agent |
| 5 | Method note `findings/m8_10_method_note.md`: equations first, equation-to-code map, audit record, manifests |
| 6 | Author package landed byte-identical to its hashes and compared for provenance only after the verdict, with the asymmetry stated |
| 7 | Doc sync (roadmap row and briefing), doc checker and roadmap linter exit 0, TASK REVIEW presented |

### What is frozen

From the designer's freeze the values stop moving on the author's side: no edit because a computed result disagrees with a frozen value. A disagreement is a result, and a claim that this text is defective goes to maintainer reproduction under #512. This binds the author, not the maintainers.

### Scheduling

Maintainer-run at maintainer pace. Nothing else in the column waits on it.

## GO-TIME PRE-REGISTRATION (2026-09-13, go 09:37 EDT)

Written by the designer and frozen before any agent received a packet. Nothing in this section is edited after the solver and auditor launch; anything the run forces off it goes in the deviations log below.

### The go-time checklist, answered

| Item | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Deposit pin | verified at the review of [#546](https://github.com/openwave-labs/openwave/pull/546): the Zenodo record returns `the-surviving-ray.pdf`, MD5 `d2405316e20c060f53d338c1516298bc`, 589,476 bytes |
| Claims frozen | the claims tables above, as written, with no value edited. C1 and C3 are graded at `R1` to `R4` only; anything an agent reports for items 7 and 8 at `R5` is recorded as a diagnostic, and D2 is graded on item 6 |
| Instrument | the offered worklist, adopted with one change: items 4, 7, 8 and 9 ask at `R1` to `R5` uniformly, so the instrument no longer marks `R5` as different (the note in the #546 review) |
| Handout audit | maintainer-side, two passes: the semantic read at the #546 review, and a go-time value-pattern gate over all 48 frozen fractions, 12 decimals and 77 integers of three or more digits. No graded value appears in the handout; the only matches are `12/25`, which defines `R5`, and the supplied `48` and `18` |
| Run format | two blind agents in separate rooms, then the auditor's second stage over the solver's work, per the roles table below. Earns blind |
| Exactness rule | exact means a symbolic derivation, or a rational identification that states its precision and denominator bound and repeats at a second precision. The record labels each value by which route produced it; the author's own values are identifications ([§ Candidate claims](#candidate-pre-registered-claims)) |
| Compute | each room's interpreter pins the math libraries to one thread and runs at `nice 15`, beside a concurrent maintainer workload |
| Answer-key containment | the table below |
| Author's package | not yet in the repository. The provenance comparison waits for its landing PR, after the verdict |

| Packet file | SHA-256 | Bytes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `worklist.md` (both rooms) | `52ae85c759c5111d78f5fe69c687b593271ea4db6d99f483eb17a977921acacd` | 6,776 |
| `BRIEF.md` (solver) | `5fa38668f281b9e33578703db92348aba6eb7c52f19606732df016e94e1f9be6` | 1,399 |
| `BRIEF.md` (auditor, stage 1) | `0d519010dbafe509fab21d93f32747624bc86052bea9f048240e2d8096c8e0e5` | 1,872 |

The packet files land beside the returns at FINISH, under `m8_10/`.

### Containment: where the answer key lives, and what walls it off

The frozen claims live in this file, in the maintainers' working tree. No agent is given a repository path.

| Route to the answers | Guard |
| --- | --- |
| This file and every repository document | agents are given only their room directory; solver and auditor get separate rooms |
| Web search and fetch, connectors, spawning agents | withheld by the agent definition's tool allowlist: read, write, edit and shell only |
| The Python route | each room's interpreter runs without site processing, so `import openwave` fails from inside the room, while the numerics load (Python 3.12.14, numpy 2.5.3, scipy 1.18.1, sympy 1.14.0, mpmath 1.3.0) |
| Instruction files on the room's ancestor path | checked on the room directory: none |
| What loads unavoidably | a canary agent, run before any packet existed, reported the user-global instruction file, a project instruction file and a memory index, none answer-bearing: no value, equation, ray or claim. The index names the author and the column, and one line names this task's ID. Holding that line on disk did not reach the agents, which receive the session's start-time snapshot; it is disclosed as a named load |
| The filesystem outside the room | NOT sandboxed. At FINISH every agent's transcript is audited for any tool call reaching outside its room; a hit is a protocol failure |

### Roles and ordering

| Step | Who | Receives | Before the next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | solver and auditor, in parallel, separate rooms | the worklist and a brief. The auditor writes its method before computing, and is directed to a route that shares no library coupling tables with a Clebsch-Gordan approach | each return saved verbatim to a checkpoint and hashed |
| 2 | auditor, context continued | the solver's scripts and return, copied into its room | per-claim verdicts (confirmed, partial, refuted) and a hunt for solver checks that cannot fail |
| 3 | designer | everything | comparison against the frozen claims, X0 as a precondition and X1 to X4 recorded apart from the claim verdicts |
| 4 | designer, only after the verdict is recorded | the author's package, when it lands | provenance comparison, with the agreement and disagreement asymmetry stated |

## DEVIATIONS LOG

| Date | Deviation | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-13 | The auditor ran eight commands in the background, and the tool harness wrote their output to its own task folder outside the room; the auditor read six of those files back (11 references) | No other file outside the room was touched. The same folder held the solver's and the canary's transcripts, and the transcript audit shows neither was opened; the stage-1 comparison was therefore made with no view of the solver's work |
| 2026-09-13 | The transcript-audit pattern flagged 15 of the auditor's 69 calls, four of them Python code whose division operators matched the absolute-path rule | Each flag was classified by extracting every path outside the room from the command; the 11 real references are the row above. The pattern had been mutation-tested before use on eight synthetic out-of-room calls |
| 2026-09-13 | The auditor's eight console logs carried a `.log` extension, which the repository ignores | Landed byte-identical as `*_log.txt` under [`../scripts/m8_10_audit/`](../scripts/m8_10_audit/), the M8.1.2 raw-output naming; only the names moved. The returns `AUDIT_STAGE1.md`, `AUDIT_STAGE2.md` and the solver's `RETURN.md` landed renamed to `*_return.md`, content unchanged |
| 2026-09-13 | The auditor's `METHOD.md` wrote literal `\|` inside table cells, which breaks its rows when rendered | In the landed copy, the pipes inside seven cells are escaped as `\|`, a rendering change only; every other agent file landed byte-identical, and the unedited bytes of all of them are hashed in the maintainer's run checkpoints |
| 2026-09-13 | The designer's comparison script first read the solver's level keys as `j = n/2` and printed B1 as a failure | The keys are levels `n`; the script was corrected before any verdict was recorded, and the solver's B1 values were unchanged |
| 2026-09-13 | The author's package landed with two of its sixteen pinned files, `audit_dryrun.py` and `dryrun/transcript.jsonl`, as privacy redactions instead of byte-identical ([#550](https://github.com/openwave-labs/openwave/pull/550)): local paths became placeholders, and the transcript's startup and account rate-limit records became marker lines carrying the SHA-256 of each removed line | Accepted by the maintainer. The other fourteen match their pins; the package's [`MANIFEST.md`](../scripts/m8_10_author/MANIFEST.md) gives both hashes of every file, and [`redact.py`](../scripts/m8_10_author/redact.py) is the whole transformation. The pinned bytes of the two files stay with the author and were not inspected by the maintainers; nothing in the verdict rests on the dry run |

## FINDINGS

Full record with the equations, the code map and the audit: [`../findings/m8_10_method_note.md`](../findings/m8_10_method_note.md).

| ID | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| F1 | **Every frozen claim reproduces blind.** A1 to D2 match in both agents, computed by separate implementations that never saw a claimed value; the auditor then confirmed the solver on items 0 to 8 value by value and reran its code with no difference |
| F2 | **The candidate rationals are now derived.** Both agents obtained the 36 level norms and the eight `λ₄/g²` by exact symbolic routes, so the values the task filed as rational identifications stand as exact results. `λ₄ < 0` at all eight expansions, argued two ways |
| F3 | **The negative control fired blind.** With the handout asking the same questions at all five rays, both agents found that the order-`a⁵` block equation has a component orthogonal to `Φ` at `R5`, with identical exact values, so the fixed-ray expansion fails there as D2 predicted |
| F4 | ⚠️ **The block cubic's coefficient form is not unique.** The seven `M_K` span four dimensions, so A1's frozen form is one valid representation; no value moves |
| F5 | ⚠️ **Four checks in the solver cannot fail.** Its order-`a³` residual cannot see an error in `N(Φ)` (it does catch a mislabeled level, which is what X4 asks), and three recorded failures never stop the run. No number is affected, since the auditor reproduced each by its own route |
| F6 | **Level 16 vanishes by time reversal**, as B3b states, through a Jacobian identity the auditor derived; the solver proved the same zeros by exact cancellation without naming the mechanism |
| F7 | **Containment held on the record.** The solver made no call outside its room in 49; the auditor's only outside references in 90 are the output files of its own background commands |

## PROVENANCE COMPARISON (2026-09-13)

Made by the designer after the verdict was recorded, against the author's package as landed in [#550](https://github.com/openwave-labs/openwave/pull/550) under [`../scripts/m8_10_author/`](../scripts/m8_10_author/). The package's code ran in a copy of the folder, under an OS sandbox that refused network access and every read outside the copy, with the copy hashed before the run.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Pins | fourteen of sixteen files byte-identical to the hashes above; two landed redacted, per the deviations log |
| Regeneration | `python3 m810_results.py` rewrote `RESULTS.md` byte-identical to its pin in 19 s, every gate script ending on its pass line and both precisions giving identical fractions; no other file in the package changed |
| Package against the frozen claims | 76 exact equalities and no mismatch: A2 eight, B2 36, C1 eight and C3 four, plus the identities `λ₄/g² = −3 Σ (n(n+2) − 48) ‖Π_n ξ‖²/g²`, `‖ξ‖² = Σ ‖Π_n ξ‖²` and the four ratios; the B3a zero census eight of eight |
| Package against the blind agents | equal on every value, through the frozen claims both agents reproduced exactly (F1) |
| Dry-run containment | the landed audit reports 55 tool calls, CLEAN, and the landed comparison 103 matches with its planted mutation firing. A maintainer audit keyed on the redaction's placeholders agrees: every home-directory path in a tool input lies in the dry-run room |

**The asymmetry.** Agreement here is weak evidence. The frozen claims came from this package, so the third row shows only that they were frozen from the code that landed, and a convention error shared by the package and the worklist would survive the fourth. What rules that out is F1 and F2: two agents with separate implementations derived every value without seeing one. A disagreement at any row would have been strong evidence of a defect, and there is none.

Two observations on the dry-run record, neither affecting a value. On the redacted transcript the landed `audit_dryrun.py` is weaker than its pinned original in two shapes: its shell-command pattern looks for `/Users` and its token list for `.claude/projects`, and the redaction rewrote both to placeholders; the maintainer audit above covers both. And the dry-run session compacted three times, each compaction summary naming the session's full transcript, a file outside the room; no tool call opened it.
