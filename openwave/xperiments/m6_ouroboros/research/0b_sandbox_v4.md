# 2026-05-18 evening — Sandbox v4: Lepton scan + awaiting Werbos's code

Triggered by Werbos's reply at 19:39 on 2026-05-18 (via DeepSeek; Paul is 78
and copy-pastes DeepSeek's drafts when tired). The reply addresses three of
the four immediate questions from v3, promises the Python source within 1-2
days, and gives an operational hypothesis for the discrete-ω selection
mechanism that v4 can test directly.

**Source:** Email thread continuation, "Intro & Nice to eMeet You" / reply
chain. Rodrigo responded at 20:10 acknowledging the late hour, will resume
2026-05-19.

## What Werbos's reply answered (vs v3 end-of-file items)

```text
v3 ID | v3 status            | Werbos reply (2026-05-18 19:39)
------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------
Q12   | NOT ON ZENODO        | PROMISED — "I'll share the Python source for the
      | (asked directly)     | Q=0 scan and the calibration run... Give me a day
      |                      | or two to get the files to you." Under QAGI LLC.
Q13   | PENDING — 4→2 fn     | EXPLAINED — Lorenz constraint locks (V,Q) and
      | reduction?           | (A,J) into pairs:
      |                      |   Δ_r V = Q  → Q determined by V
      |                      |   Δ_r A = J  → J determined by A
      |                      | Operational rule: use 4-fn for CHARGED calibration,
      |                      | 2-fn for NEUTRAL scan. ⚠️ But conflicts with the
      |                      | bosonization log's "A-field = 0" approach. → Q14.
Q2    | OPEN (3 sandboxes)   | ACKNOWLEDGED OPEN — "At this stage, the ω values
      | discrete ω           | are empirical." HYPOTHESIS provided: leptons are
      | selection?           | the lowest 3 stable modes in Q=1 sector. Analytic
      |                      | proof = "major mathematical undertaking", deferred.
      |                      | v4 lepton scan tests this hypothesis directly.
Q8    | PARTIAL (v3)         | (not directly addressed; will be settled by code)
Q9    | RESOLVED (v3)        | (no change)
```

### New question surfaced (Q14)

Werbos's DeepSeek reply says for the NEUTRAL chaoiton: `J(r) = -A(r)` AND
`Q(r) = -V(r)` (locked ansatz → single β). But his earlier bosonization
session log (May 18 4PM) said the neutral chaoiton has `A-field = 0, pure
J-field` (no locked relation, just A turned off).

```text
Description         | Source                | Our experiment
--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------
Locked: J=-A, Q=-V  | DeepSeek reply 19:39  | Sandbox v2 — FAILED (no soln)
A-field = 0         | Bosonization 4PM log  | Sandbox v3 — 23 SOLUTIONS ✅
```

These are different setups giving different empirical outcomes. v3 (A=0)
worked; v2 (locked) didn't. The DeepSeek summary may be approximating; the
actual code in his bosonization session probably used A=0. The Python source
(Q12) will resolve this definitively.

→ **Q14: Which is the canonical Q=0 description — locked ansatz or A=0?**

              | proceed with v3 as canonical          |      |
```

### Track 1 — Lepton scan (highest-value next test)

Setup:

```text
ODE:       α'' + (1/r)α' − α/r² + ω²α = β
           β'' + (1/r)β' − β/r² + ω²β = α − λβ − 4gβ³
Params:    g = 1.0625, λ = 1.0  (electron-calibration values)
ω scan:    [0.5, 50] in steps of 0.5 (~100 points)
BCs:       α ~ A₀·r, β ~ B₀·r at origin (slopes; field=0 at r=0)
           α, β → 0 at r_max = 30
Stability: at each ω, check conjugate-point (Gelfand-Fomin) per
           Lean theorem §stability_condition
Outputs:   - localized solutions found at each ω
           - H/Q at each localized ω
           - mass predictions via m = H × m_e / H_electron
           - flag the 3 lowest-energy ω values → candidate leptons
Expected:  per Werbos's bosonization (May 18 4PM):
             ω = 1.0   → electron 0.511 MeV (calibration)
             ω = 12.78 → muon 106.8 MeV (1.1% gap)
             ω = 15.0  → pion+ 145.1 MeV (3.9% gap)
             ω ≈ 40-41 → tau (predicted)
Test:      if our 3 lowest stable ω values match leptons →
           Werbos's hypothesis (lepton = stable mode) confirmed
```

Effort: 1-2 days. New script `sandbox_v4/m6_v4_lepton_scan.py`.

**Calibration dependency (carried over from v3 ⚠️):** T1 anchors on ω=1.0
producing the electron baseline. v3 ended with H/Q = 1.723 (1.56% gap)
NOT localized. If T1 still can't localize at ω=1.0 with current energy
functional, we have no baseline to convert H_code → MeV for muon/tau
predictions. Two fallback paths:

```text
Path | Action                              | Pre-condition
-----|-------------------------------------|-----------------------
A    | Wait for T3 (Werbos's code) and    | Best if code arrives
     | use his energy functional with     | soon (1-2 days)
     | toroidal geometry factor (2π)²R    |
B    | Try alternative energy formulas    | If T3 delayed; lower
     | (add (2π)²R prefactor explicitly;  | confidence but
     | rescale H by 1/r at r=8; etc.)     | unblocks T1
```

Recommended: try Path B for a few hours first (cheap experiment);
if localization is still elusive, wait for T3.

### Track 2 — Neutral chaoiton ground state

Refine v3 sandbox to find the minimum-energy localized β solution by
shooting on B0 with bisection. Current: 0.508 MeV at B0=0.010. Expected: a
slightly lighter ground state below B0=0.010 — possibly approaching
Werbos's 0.003-0.015 MeV estimate, possibly not.

Effort: ~1 day. Either new script or augment `sandbox_v3/m6_v3_chaoiton.py`.

### Track 3 — Werbos's code (waiting)

Will give us:

- The exact energy functional with toroidal geometry factor → closes
  the calibration 1.56% gap (currently not localized)
- The canonical Q=0 description (Q14) — locked or A=0
- The full lepton scan code (independent cross-check on Track 1)
- The conjugate-point stability test implementation

ETA: 1-2 days per Werbos's reply.

## SANDBOX v4 RESULTS, ROADBLOCKS, NEXT STEPS

### T1 first run — 2026-05-19 (BLOCKED on wrong ODE form)

Built `sandbox_v4/m6_v4_lepton_scan.py` adapting the canonical Lean 2-fn
ODE from v3 into an ω-sweep. Quick scan run on ω ∈ {1, 5, 10, 12.78, 15,
20, 25, 30, 35, 40.7, 45} at g=1.0625, λ=1.0, (A0, B0) grid {0.05, 0.1,
0.5}². Total 99 integrations in 20.5s.

```text
Outcome              | Status
---------------------|--------------------------------------------------
Script works         | ✅ Localized solutions found at 10/11 ω values
                     |    (ω≥5; ω=1.0 marginally fails localization)
H scaling with ω     | ❌ DECREASING — opposite to Werbos's bosonization
                     |    H_full(12.78)/H_full(1.0) ≈ 0.04 (need 207 for muon)
Calibration H/Q      | ❌ Our H/Q at (ω=1.0, A0=B0=0.1) ≈ 1.04
                     |    Werbos: H/Q = 1.6969 (electron). 38% off.
v3 constant wrong    | ⚠️  H_CODE_ELECTRON_CALIB = 0.494 in v3 is wrong;
                     |    real H_spat at calib point ≈ 10.7 (close to
                     |    bosonization log's 11.4)
```

### Root cause: T1 is using the wrong ODE

Re-reading Q13 of Werbos's reply: the Lorenz constraint locks pairs
(V, Q) and (A, J), giving an operational rule:

```text
Sector     | ODE form used     | Status
-----------|-------------------|--------------------------------
Neutral    | 2-fn (Lean)       | ✅ v3 found 23 solutions
(α=0, ω=0) |                   |
Charged    | 4-fn (v5 paper)   | ❌ T1 used 2-fn — WRONG TOOL
(ω≠0)      | (φ, α, ρ, β)      |
```

The bosonization-session lepton scan that got ω=12.78 → muon 1.1% gap
ran Werbos's **earlier 4-function code**, *before* the May 18 Lean
reduction. The Lean 2-fn ODE is the structure-existence proof; it's
the reduced form for the Q=0 sector. Charged calibration + lepton scan
need the full 4-fn ansatz.

### What T1 needs to actually run

```text
Need                                  | Source / unblock
--------------------------------------|--------------------------------
Explicit 4-fn ODE (φ, α, ρ, β)        | (a) Werbos's Python source (Q12;
  with toroidal volume element and    |     ETA 2026-05-20, his promise)
  electron-calibration energy formula | (b) Manual extraction from
                                      |     v5 paper §6 + Numerical
                                      |     Benchmark docx (medium effort)
Correct H_CODE_ELECTRON_CALIB         | Implied by the above; v3's 0.494
                                      | is structurally wrong
Stability test (Gelfand-Fomin         | Needed even after ODE fix to rank
  conjugate-point)                    | "stable modes" per Werbos hypothesis
```

### Diagnostic kept

`sandbox_v4/diag_energy_functional.py` records the 2-fn H-scaling failure
and the H_full = H_spat + ω·Q identity. Keep for cross-check once 4-fn
code lands — the 2-fn form still applies to the Q=0 sandbox track.

### T1 decision

**HOLD T1.** Pivoting to T2 (neutral ground state via B₀ shooting) is
the right next move — it runs on the 2-fn Lean ODE we already have,
refines a v3 result rather than testing a hypothesis with the wrong
tool, and doesn't burn cycles guessing at Werbos's energy functional.

Resume T1 when:

```text
Trigger                              | Action
-------------------------------------|------------------------------
Werbos's code arrives (T3 unblocks)  | Adopt his 4-fn calibration
                                     | + lepton scan code as ground truth
OR ω=2026-05-20 +1d passes w/o code  | Manual 4-fn extraction from
                                     | v5 paper §6 + Numerical Benchmark
                                     | (slower, more uncertain)
```

---

### T2 first run — 2026-05-19 (NEGATIVE RESULT, corrects v3 overclaim)

Built `sandbox_v4/m6_v4_t2_neutral_ground.py`. Wide log-scan B₀ ∈
[1e-5, 1.0], 60 points, six λ values {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0},
r_max=30, plus golden-section bisection at λ=1.0.

```text
What we found              | What it means
---------------------------|----------------------------------------------
H is monotonic in B₀       | H grows like B₀^~3 (cubic-dominant scaling)
  across [1e-5, 1.0]       | for all λ. No minimum exists.
H → 0 as B₀ → 0            | "Ground state" of v3 was just trivial near-
                           | zero solution. Not a physical chaoiton.
Solution de-localizes at   | At λ=1.0: ~B₀=0.35. At larger λ: later.
moderate B₀ (~0.3-0.7)     | This is where the cubic term breaks the
                           | small-amplitude Bessel oscillation pattern.
Radial-node count 13-29    | Lean stability spec: ≤4 nodes. EVERY scan
                           | point violates this. The linear part is
                           | β''+β'/r-β/r²+λβ = J₁(√λ r) Bessel —
                           | inherently oscillatory.
```

**v3's "23 neutral chaoiton solutions" are artifacts.** Localization
was checked with `|β(r)| < 0.1 at r ≥ 8`, but at small B₀ the entire
oscillatory Bessel solution stays below 0.1 in absolute terms — not
because it decays, but because the amplitude itself is small. A
proper localization check needs EITHER node-count regularity (≤4 per
Lean) OR a decay-rate test (β² fall-off at large r relative to peak).

### What this implies for Q=0 / DM scan

The canonical Q=0 / neutral-chaoiton description is now in **triple
conflict**:

```text
Description              | Source                  | Empirical status
-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------
Locked: J=-A, Q=-V       | DeepSeek 19:39 reply    | v2 — FAILED
                         | (single β via locked    |   (no localized
                         |  ansatz)                |    solution found)
A-field=0, ω=0           | Bosonization 4PM log    | v3 claimed ✅;
  (α=0 reduction)        |                         | T2 DISPROVES
                         |                         |   (23 v3 solutions
                         |                         |    are artifacts)
Q_A≈0, Q_J≠0             | Bosonization log later  | UNTESTED — both
  (both fields active,   |   ("Q_A ≈ 0, Q_J ≠ 0")  | A and J fields
   EM charge zero but    |                         | active under
   nuclear charge ≠0)    |                         | constraint
```

→ This sharpens **Q14**: the canonical Q=0 description is one of THREE
candidates, not two. Werbos's code (Q12) is now the only clean path to
resolution. Without it, we cannot run a credible neutral chaoiton scan.

### T2 decision

**T2 CLOSED as negative.** Neutral-chaoiton existence in the canonical
Lean 2-fn form is not confirmed. v3's m_χ=0.508 MeV figure should be
treated as obsolete in roadmap and gates. Re-run only after Q14 is
settled.

### Sandbox v4 status (end of 2026-05-19 first-run)

```

### T5 — 4-fn ODE extracted (2026-05-19)

The Numerical Benchmark for the Ouroboros Lagrangian docx was **not
"wrong ODE form" as v3 notes claimed** — it's the canonical 4-fn ODE
source. The "wrong ODE" call was based on a misreading. Findings:

**4-fn benchmark ODE** (with mapping to our 2-fn notation):

```text
Mapping:  φ = V (A_0)   α = A (A_φ)   ρ = Q (J_0)   β = J (J_φ)
Convention: Δ_r f = f'' + (1/r)·f'    (NO -f/r² — toroidal, l=0)

Δ_r V  =  Q                                  (eq 1, Coulomb-type)
Δ_r A  =  J                                  (eq 2, Ampere-type)
Δ_r Q  =  V  +  m_J²·Q  +  λ·Q·(Q² − J²)     (eq 3)
Δ_r J  =  A  −  m_J²·J  −  λ·J·(Q² − J²)     (eq 4)
```

**Boundary conditions:**

```text
At r → 0:  V'(0) = A'(0) = Q'(0) = J'(0) = 0
           (VALUE BC, fields nonzero at origin — NOT slope BC)
           Calibration: V(0) = A(0) = Q(0) = J(0) = 0.1
At r → ∞:  all fields → 0, decay as modified Bessel K_0(κr)
```

**Energy functional** (toroidal volume element, NOT spherical 4πr²):

```text
H = (2π)²·R · ∫_0^∞ r dr [ (V')² + (A')² + (Q')² + (J')²
                          − V·Q + A·J
                          + (m_J²/2)·(Q² − J²)
                          + (λ/4)·(Q² − J²)² ]
```

**Charge functional** (Chern-Simons in toroidal form):

```text
Q_CS = (2π·R) ∫_0^∞ r dr [ A·(∂_r J) − J·(∂_r A) ]
Identity: L/Q = ω    →    2·L/Q = g-factor
```

**Calibration anchor (corrected):**

```text
Param                       | Value
----------------------------|------------------
g                           | 1.0625
λ                           | 1.0
ω                           | 1.0
V₀ = A₀ = Q₀ = J₀           | 0.1
H/Q (target, m_e/e_nat)     | 1.6875
H/Q (Werbos predicted)      | 1.6969 (0.56% gap)
Q_CS                        | 1 (integer, electron)
L/Q                         | ω = 1.000 → g_e = 2.000 (0.116%)
```

**v3 H_CODE_ELECTRON_CALIB = 0.494 is wrong**; the bosonization log's
H=11.4, Q=8.7 figures are from an earlier abandoned Compton calibration
iteration. The single authoritative anchor for charged sector is
**H/Q = 1.6969 at the canonical point.**

### T5 gaps (medium confidence — implementation risks)

```

The structural difference between Lean ODE and Benchmark ODE is the
*real* unknown — it's not that one is a "reduction" of the other.
They appear to be different ansatz choices for the chaoiton geometry.
Werbos's pre-Lean charged-scan code uses the Benchmark form; the Lean
theorem proves existence for a different (l=1 angular) ansatz.

### Concrete next test (Werbos proposed)

> "Try the m_eff fix for the electron and see if that closes your
> 1.56% gap."

This is the single highest-leverage validation: implement the 4-fn
benchmark ODE with the m_eff² substitution and run at the canonical
electron calibration point. If H/Q lands at 1.6969 (within Werbos's
0.56% target gap), we have the correct charged ODE form.

### Implementation plan — v4 Path A → CONFIRMED GO

The Q12 (code) ask is still LIVE but no longer blocking. If Werbos's
code arrives mid-implementation, we cross-check against our results.

### Update to question statuses

Several IMMEDIATE-QUESTIONS resolve with this reply (see updated
tables below). Q14 in particular moves from "3-way conflict" to
"resolved-in-principle: Q_A≈0/Q_J≠0 is canonical".

---

### T6 first run — 2026-05-19 PM (4-fn IVP, negative result)

Built `sandbox_v4/m6_v4_4fn.py` per Werbos's clarifications:
benchmark ODE with `m_eff² = m_J² − ω²` substitution, value BCs
`V(R_MIN)=A(R_MIN)=Q(R_MIN)=J(R_MIN)=0.1`, derivatives zero at origin,
toroidal R=1, ω-kinetic term included in energy density. Started
with RK45 → numerical stiffness → tried LSODA → hung → returned to
RK45 with `max_step=0.05` and a `BLOWUP_THRESHOLD=100` termination
event. Scan grid: m_J² ∈ {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 10} × λ_bench ∈
{0.5, 1, 2, 4.25, 10}. All 40 combinations completed.

**Result: every combination blew up. No localized solution found.**

```

### What this finding means

The 4-fn benchmark ODE is an **eigenvalue / shooting problem**, not
a plain IVP. Werbos's `V₀=A₀=Q₀=J₀=0.1` only gives a bound state at
ONE specific (m_J², λ_bench) calibrated point, not generically.
Working from arbitrary (m_J², λ_bench) with those initial values
gives saddle-point dynamics where the unbound mode dominates.

Equivalent statement: a chaoiton is the rare initial condition
within an 8-dimensional phase space `(V, V', A, A', Q, Q', J, J')`
that decays at infinity. Generic ICs blow up. The "calibration"
is finding that rare initial condition.

### Three paths forward

```

**Sequencing (per Rodrigo, 2026-05-19 afternoon):**

1. Document this T6 finding now (this section)
2. Build T6→A (BVP solver) — first solo attempt
3. Review + document T6→A outcome
4. If A succeeds → use it for calibration; if not → move to T7 (B shooting)
5. Review + document T7 outcome
6. Ask Werbos with whatever specific question we've narrowed down to

The escalation principle: prove what we tried solo before going back
to him. His ApJ paper timeline is also our timeline; if we can do
the work without burning his cycles, that's better.

### What v3's 1.56% gap really meant

Werbos's "try the m_eff fix for the 1.56% gap" was about the LEAN
2-fn ODE (which v3 used). T6 shows the m_eff² substitution applied
to the 4-fn benchmark ODE doesn't trivially give bound states from
generic ICs. The 1.56% gap closing test would need to be on the
2-fn ODE specifically — which is now confirmed-wrong-tool for the
charged sector. So that specific test is moot. The benchmark ODE
calibration through BVP/shooting is the real anchor.

---

### T6→A — BVP solver attempt (Path A, 2026-05-19 PM)

Built `sandbox_v4/m6_v4_4fn_bvp.py` using `scipy.integrate.solve_bvp`
with eigenvalue parameter(s). Two formulations tried:

#### Formulation 1: single eigenvalue (m_J²) + 1 normalization (V_norm)

```text
BCs (9 total for 8-dim state + 1 param):
  V(R_MIN) = 0.1  (eats trivial sol'n attractor)
  V'(R_MIN) = A'(R_MIN) = Q'(R_MIN) = J'(R_MIN) = 0  (regularity)
  V(r_max) = A(r_max) = Q(r_max) = J(r_max) = 0      (decay)
Unknown: m_J²
```

Result: **converges, but to 2-fn subset.** A(r) and J(r) collapse
to zero identically. The (V, Q) sub-system finds a non-trivial
bound state via eigenvalue m_J²; (A, J) decouples spontaneously
because A=J=0 is a stable solution branch of the system.

```text
r_max=12  → m_J²_fit = 0.0933  m_eff² = -0.907  peak = 0.154  Q_CS = 0
r_max=24  → m_J²_fit = 0.9403  m_eff² = -0.060  peak = 0.103  Q_CS = 0
```

The r_max-dependence of the eigenvalue (0.09 → 0.94 as r_max
doubles) is a **Bessel-zero artifact signature** — the BVP is
catching oscillating J_0 solutions that happen to have a zero at
r_max, not genuine exponential-decay bound states. Negative m_eff²
in both cases confirms the bound-state regime is not reached.

**Formulation 2: two eigenvalues (m_J², λ_bench) + 2 normalizations
(V_norm, A_norm)**

```text
BCs (10 total for 8-dim state + 2 params):
  V(R_MIN) = 0.1, A(R_MIN) = 0.1  (eats trivial AND eats A→0 attractor)
  V'=A'=Q'=J' = 0 at origin
  V=A=Q=J = 0 at r_max
Unknowns: m_J², λ_bench
```

Result: **all 36 scan combinations fail with "singular Jacobian
encountered in collocation system."** The Jacobian is ill-conditioned
near the initial guess because the two BC sensitivities (∂/∂m_J²,
∂/∂λ_bench) are likely linearly dependent at the starting point.
2-eigenvalue BVP problems are fragile this way.

### T6→A diagnosis

```text
What we proved             | What it means
---------------------------|-------------------------------------------
BVP finds (V,Q) bound      | The Coulomb-like (V↔Q) sub-system has
state spontaneously        | bound-state structure; well-posed alone.
                           |

                           | exponential decay. m_eff² stays negative.

fails with singular        | Could be fixable with smarter initial
Jacobian                   | guess or scaling, but high-risk.
```

The fundamental issue: **`Q_CS = 1` is an integral / topological
constraint, not a boundary condition.** scipy.solve_bvp can enforce
boundary values but not integral conditions. To pin Q_CS = 1, we'd
need either (a) a Lagrange-multiplier reformulation, (b) shooting on
(m_J², λ_bench, V₀, A₀, ...) with Q_CS as a residual, or (c) Werbos's
explicit calibration values.

### T6→A decision

**Path A is partial-success / partial-fail.** It validates the
eigenvalue structure (BVP found a bound state) but can't pin the
specific 4-fn chaoiton with Q_CS=1. Two productive directions:

```text
Direction                  | Effort   | Risk    | Note
---------------------------|----------|---------|-------------------
T7 — shooting on (m_J²,    | 2-3 hr   | High    | More flexible
λ_bench, V₀, A₀, Q₀, J₀)   |          |         | than BVP, can
with Q_CS=1, H/Q=1.6969    |          |         | use Q_CS as

```

T6→A is documented and scripts archived. Proceeding to T7.

### T7 — Shooting refinement (Path B, 2026-05-19 PM)

Built `sandbox_v4/m6_v4_4fn_shoot.py`. Used "r_blowup distance" as a
continuous figure of merit: in a bound state, the IVP would integrate
to r_max without exceeding threshold; in a non-bound state, blowup
happens at some finite r. **Larger r_blowup ≈ closer to eigenvalue.**

**Coarse 2D scan** over (m_J², λ_bench) ∈ [0.5, 8] × [0.1, 10] with
V₀=A₀=Q₀=J₀=0.1, r_max=15:

```text
Observation                 | Detail
----------------------------|------------------------------------------
Maximum r_blowup = 6.44     | Well below r_max=15 → no bound state in
                            | this parameter window
m_J²=1.0 row is flat at 6.44| Degenerate: m_eff²=0 makes the cubic
                            | term irrelevant (λ_bench drops out)
r_blowup decreases as m_J²  | Larger mass → faster nonlinear blowup,
increases above 1.0         | not stabilization. Opposite of expected.
r_blowup also decreases as  | The λ_bench·(Q²-J²) coupling is
λ_bench grows               | destabilizing in this regime.
```

**Amplitude shoot** at fixed (m_J²=2.0, λ_bench=1.0), sweeping
V₀=A₀=Q₀=J₀=A_0 from 0.001 to 1.0:

```text
A_0        | r_blowup | Note
-----------|----------|----------------
0.001      | 7.77     | Largest seen
0.1        | 3.68     | Werbos's calib val
1.0        | 1.75     | Strong blowup
```

**r_blowup is monotone decreasing in A_0.** As A_0 → 0, r_blowup → ∞
(the trivial solution V=A=Q=J=0). There's no resonance / sweet spot
at non-zero amplitude where the bound state lives.

### T7 finding

For the **symmetric ansatz** V₀ = A₀ = Q₀ = J₀, there is **NO bound
state** at any tested (m_J², λ_bench) ∈ [0.5, 8] × [0.1, 10] and any
amplitude A_0 > 0.

This means **Werbos's calibration must use asymmetric initial values**
— V₀ ≠ A₀ ≠ Q₀ ≠ J₀ — OR substantially different (m_J², λ_bench)
values outside our scan window OR a different normalization / shooting
parameter we haven't identified.

### T7 decision: Werbos ask is now the highest-leverage action

T6 + T6→A + T7 collectively establish:

The question for Werbos has narrowed from "send your code" to
"share these 2-4 specific numbers", which is much smaller ask and
respects his time / QAGI LLC constraints. If he answers, we're
unblocked instantly. If not, we have rich documented findings to
include in a slower full code request.

### Werbos / DeepSeek helicity clarification — 2026-05-19 4:21 PM

Werbos replied (via DeepSeek again) with the EXACT diagnosis we
needed. The symmetric ansatz forces Q_CS=0 by symmetry. The Q_CS=1
chaoiton requires **opposite helicity** between the (V, Q) and (A, J)
subsystems.

> "The Chern-Simons linking number Q_CS = 1 requires a specific
> relative sign (helicity) between the (V, Q) and (A, J) subsystems.
> The symmetric ansatz V₀ = A₀ = Q₀ = J₀ = 0.1 forces both subsystems
> to have the same sign structure, which locks Q_CS = 0. The chaoiton
> with Q_CS = 1 requires opposite helicity between the two subsystems
> — typically V, Q positive and A, J negative, or vice versa."

**Specific calibration values (verbatim from DeepSeek):**

```text
Field    Value    Sign
V(0)     0.1      positive
A(0)     0.1      negative  (or vice versa)
Q(0)     0.1      positive
J(0)     0.1      negative  (or vice versa)

Critical: V and Q must have the same sign; A and J must have the
same sign; the (V, Q) pair must have opposite sign to the (A, J)
pair. This asymmetry is what gives Q_CS = 1.

Parameters:
  m_J²        | ≈ 0.5 (mixed case) OR 0 (pure-quartic case)
  λ_bench     | 1.0 (mixed case) OR 4g = 4.25 (pure-quartic case)
  m_eff²      | m_J² − ω² = -0.5 (negative; oscillatory core,
              | correct for time-periodic solution)
  ω           | 1.0 (electron calibration)
```

**Shooting strategy (verbatim):**

> "The Q_CS = 1 chaoiton is found by a shooting method with the
> asymmetric initial signs, treating the decay rate at infinity as
> the target. The energy functional automatically selects the
> correct profile once the helicity is set correctly."

### Resolution of Q15, Q16, Q17

```

### Implication for v4 implementation

The "fix" turns out to be a 4-character code change: flip A₀ and J₀
signs from +0.1 to -0.1. T6 + T7 explored ONLY the symmetric ansatz
and missed this because we treated (V₀, A₀, Q₀, J₀) as a single
common amplitude. Once asymmetric, the (V,Q) and (A,J) pairs are
fundamentally distinguishable in the cubic Q(Q²-J²) and J(Q²-J²)
terms — they were degenerate when V=A and Q=J.

### Next: re-run T6 + T7 with helicity

Specifically:

1. Update `m6_v4_4fn.py` to allow independent (V₀, A₀, Q₀, J₀) signs
2. Run single integration at (V₀=+0.1, A₀=-0.1, Q₀=+0.1, J₀=-0.1,
   m_J²=0.5, λ_bench=1.0, ω=1.0)
3. Check: does Q_CS land at +1? Does H/Q land at 1.6969?
4. If yes: run full lepton scan (vary ω) for the muon@1.1% test
5. If no: report specific failure mode and escalate

The Werbos paper draft v2 (Dark_Matter_in_Universe_v2.txt) is being
reviewed in parallel (paste-ready review delivered to Rodrigo
2026-05-19 4:30 PM ish; user-edited and to be sent imminently).

### T8 — Asymmetric-helicity re-runs (2026-05-19 PM)

Built/updated three scripts to support Werbos's helicity recipe
(V_norm=+0.1, A_norm=-0.1, Q via init guess +0.1, J via init guess
-0.1). Three scripts updated to accept --helicity argument.

**T8a — IVP at canonical (m_J²=0.5, λ_bench=1.0):**

```text
Symmetric V₀=A₀=Q₀=J₀=+0.1   | Q_CS = 0 (T6 baseline)
Asymmetric Werbos helicity   | Q_CS = 4483 (non-zero! helicity works)
                             | But: tail=71, IVP still blows up,
                             | Q_CS is way off target 1.
```

**Conclusion: helicity is necessary (Q_CS goes from 0 to non-zero
when symmetry breaks) but not sufficient for IVP convergence.**

**T8b — Amplitude shoot with Werbos helicity at (m_J²=0.5, λ=1):**

```text
A_0          | r_blowup (with helicity) | vs symmetric (T7)
-------------|-----------|--------------|------------------------
0.001        | 8.70      |              | (best vs sym 7.77)
0.1          | 4.12      |              | (vs sym 3.68; +12%)
1.0          | 1.96      |              | (vs sym 1.75; +12%)
```

Helicity gives ~10-15% improvement in r_blowup at each A_0, but
r_blowup is still monotone in A_0 (no resonance). No bound state
found by amplitude shooting alone.

**T8c — 1-eigenvalue BVP with asymmetric helicity initial guess:**

Updated `m6_v4_4fn_bvp.py` to: (a) revert to 1-eigenvalue (m_J²
only, λ_bench fixed) to avoid the 2-eigenvalue singular Jacobian;
(b) add helicity-aware initial guess. Drop A_norm constraint
(state_dim + 1 param = 9 BCs requires only V_norm as the extra).

Scan over m_J²_init ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 50.0, 100.0}:

```text
m_J²_init | m_J²_fit  | A(0)    | Q(0)    | Q_CS   | Notes

                                                   | a-J collapsed

                                                   | bound state
10.0      | 5.51      | -0.000  | -0.021  | 0      | converges to
                                                   | same eigenvalue
50.0      | -1.82     | 0.0003  | -0.306  | 0      | A,J non-zero
                                                   | but tiny; H/Q
                                                   | numerical noise
100.0     | (FAIL)    | -       | -       | -      | max nodes
```

The BVP converges to the same **(V, Q) bound state at m_J² = 5.51**
regardless of asymmetric initial guess. Even though we initialize
A = -V·exp(-r) and J = -Q·exp(-r), the iteration drives A → 0 and
J → 0. The asymmetric guess buys nothing because there's no BC
forcing A to stay finite at the origin.

### T8 finding

**Helicity is necessary but not sufficient for a Q_CS=1 chaoiton.**
The Q_CS=1 bound state requires either:

```text
Option A | A topological / integral constraint (Q_CS = 1 added as a
         | residual to the BVP/shooter). solve_bvp doesn't natively
         | support this; needs custom Newton on shooting parameters
         | with Q_CS as residual.
Option B | A second normalization (A_norm) that forces A non-zero,
         | with a second eigenvalue (λ_bench) to make BCs consistent.
         | We tried this in T6→A's 2-eigenvalue mode — fails with
         | singular Jacobian universally across our scan.
Option C | Better initial guess that's already in the Q_CS=1 basin,
         | so BVP iterates within it rather than escaping. Likely
         | requires Werbos's actual converged profile shapes
         | (V(r), A(r), Q(r), J(r) tabulated), not just BCs.
Option D | Werbos's actual shooting code with whatever parametrization
         | he uses ("treating the decay rate at infinity as the
         | target" — but on which shooting variable?).
```

### T8 decision

T8 is **CLOSED with partial progress**:

```text
Today's net advance              | What we proved
---------------------------------|-----------------------------------
Helicity matters                 | Q_CS depends on sign structure
                                 | (0 in sym, non-zero in asym).
                                 | Confirms Werbos/DeepSeek
                                 | helicity recipe is correct.
But not sufficient               | All formulations we tried
                                 | (IVP, BVP-1, BVP-2, shooting)
                                 | hit walls.
(V, Q) subset bound state real   | BVP repeatedly finds it at
                                 | m_J²=5.51, λ_bench=1.0,
                                 | regardless of initial guess.
                                 | This is genuine sub-physics.
```

### Next action — wait for Werbos's response to today's email

Rodrigo's email (~5:00 PM 2026-05-19) asked for:

1. Specific calibrated (m_J², λ_bench) values [Werbos's 4:21 PM
   reply already answered: m_J²≈0.5, λ_bench=1.0]
2. Asymmetric helicity prescription [DONE — Werbos answered]
3. Shooting algorithm or BVP formulation for Q_CS=1 [STILL OPEN]

The third question is the one that remains. With today's review of
his v2 paper draft, and the documented evidence that helicity alone
doesn't crack it, we expect either:

```text
Likely Werbos response | Action on receipt
-----------------------|------------------------------------------
Specific algorithm     | Implement, anchor, run scans
description (e.g.      |
"add a 5th BC of       |
Q_CS=1 via integral")  |
Tabulated profile shape| Use as warm-start for BVP; should converge
(V(r), A(r), Q(r),     | within the right basin
J(r) on a grid)        |
Full code              | The gold standard; full unblock
"Will get back"        | Continue with parallel work (M5.4 etc.)

Active question count at start of v4: 3 IMMEDIATE (Q12, Q13, Q14) + 4 STILL OPEN (Q2, Q3, Q6, Q8) = **7 load-bearing**.

The single highest-value action: run Track 1 (lepton scan) tomorrow. If our 3 lowest stable ω match leptons within Werbos's 4-6% gap claim, Q2 is effectively resolved empirically — the framework's discrete spectrum claim has direct numerical backing.
