# M5.5 + M5.6 — Paper Lagrangian, KG Emergence & Faber Regularization (math reference)

**Purpose:** the confirmed mathematical foundation for **M5.5** (the Eq.18 action) and **M5.6** (KG-from-twist emergence). §1–4: Duda's Eq.18 action, the building-block operators, the Eq.35 Euler–Lagrange evolution of the matrix field `M`, the matrix Hamiltonian, the `V(M)` options, and the transcription of Duda's Mathematica source (Fig.9) reducing the twist equation to the hedgehog Klein–Gordon — prototyped in `sandbox_v4`. §5 + §5a/§5b/§5c: the **M5.6 sandbox_v5 findings** — the KG mass is *geometric* (minimal coupling to the hedgehog connection `Â`, M5.6.1), the biaxial hedgehog's curvature `C_μν~1/r²` sources it dynamically (M5.6.2), and Faber's `Λ=q₀⁶/r₀⁴` regularization pins the mass scale `E₀∝1/r₀` (M5.6.3).

## 1. The action (Eq.18) — a Maxwell-analog `E² − B² − V` on the matrix field

```text
ℒ = Σ_{μ=1..3} ‖F_{μ0}‖²_F  −  Σ_{1≤μ<ν≤3} ‖F_{μν}‖²_F  −  V(M)
        time/"electric" curvatures (+)    spatial/"magnetic" curvatures (−)
```

`‖·‖_F` is the Frobenius norm, `A•B = Tr(AB^T)`, `‖A‖_F = √(A•A)` (Eq.17). In 4D the
Frobenius norm picks up the signature `ξ = diag(−1,1,1,1)`: `‖X‖²_ξ = Tr(XξX^Tξ)` (Eq.41) —
that is the M5.8 extension, NOT M5.5 (M5.5 is the 3D case).

## 2. Building blocks (Eq.19–20) — why the EL equation is higher-order

```text
M_μ  := ∂_μ M                                              matrix derivative (have it)
A_μ  := [M, M_μ] = M·∂_μM − ∂_μM·M                          Eq.19 — the 4-potential analogue
F_μν := ∂_μ A_ν − ∂_ν A_μ = 2(∂_μM·∂_νM − ∂_νM·∂_μM)        Eq.20 — Maurer–Cartan, =: 2F_μν
```

Because `A_μ` is itself a commutator of `M` with `∂_μM`, the curvature `F` carries `(∂M)²`
terms and the action carries `(∂M)⁴` — the EL equation is correspondingly higher-order.
This is the core reason we prototype in sympy/numpy before Taichi.

`F_{μ0}` (time index) are the "electric" curvatures `E_i`; `F_{μν}` (spatial) are the
"magnetic" curvatures `B_i`. In the rotation-generator basis the curvatures are 3-vectors
`R = F*` (dual tensor), split by energy scale into `B^1/E^1` (high-energy EM tilts),
`B^2/E^2`, `B^3/E^3` (low-energy QM twist) — see [4a §8](4a_convo_2026.05.12.md).

## 3. Potential `V(M)` (Eq.12 → Eq.13) — the Q7-open part, simple→graduate

```text
Eq.12 (start):  V(M) = Σ_i (λ_i − Λ_i)²            eigenvalue-preference; Λ = (1, δ, 0)
Eq.13 (LdG):    V_LG(M) = a·Tr(M²) − b·Tr(M³) + c·(Tr(M²))²
```

`V` defines `D = diag(Λ_i)` as the vacuum shape AND regularizes the defect-core singularity
(lets the field deviate from `D` near the core → finite energy, the running-coupling effect).
Exact form is Duda's own **open research question (Q7)** — we start from Eq.12, graduate to
Eq.13, then port Faber's regularization ([reference_faber_regularization](../../../../..)).

## 4. Euler–Lagrange evolution (Eq.35) — the equation M5.5 implements

Varying `M = ODO^T` against the SO(3) generators `G` (zeroing `δℒ`) gives, in the vacuum
case (`V=0`, fixed `D`), with `Γ_μ = O^T∂_μO`, `M̄_μ=[Γ_μ,D]`, `F̄_μν=[M̄_μ,M̄_ν]`,
`G' = [G,D]`:

```text
0 = Σ_{μν} d_{μν} Tr( F̄_μν·([Γ_ν,[M̄_μ,G']] − [Γ_μ,[M̄_ν,G']]) )
        + Tr( F̄_{μν,μ}·[M̄_ν,G'] − F̄_{μν,ν}·[M̄_μ,G'] )           (Eq.35)

    d_{μν} = +1 for μν ∈ {10, 20, 30}   (electric/time)
             −1 for μν ∈ {23, 31, 12}   (magnetic/spatial)
              0 otherwise
```

For the 3 rotation generators this collapses (Eq.37–38) to:

```text
twist  (generator Gx):   Γ²·Γ³ = Γ³·Γ²        →  Klein–Gordon for the phase ψ
tilt1  (Gy):             X¹·Γ³ = 0             →  Maxwell
tilt2  (Gz):             X¹·Γ² = 0             →  Maxwell
   with  X^i = (−∇·B^i,  ∂_0 B^i + ∇×E^i)     (Eq.37)
```

The general case adds a `G'_μ = ∂_μG' = GD_μ + D_μG^T` term (Eq.28, from `∂_μD = D_μ`) and
the `V` variation `∂L/∂(λ_i)` (Higgs-like). M5.5 starts in the vacuum/fixed-D case, then adds V.

## 5. Hedgehog reduction → Klein–Gordon (Fig.9, the M5.6 anchor + our M5.5.1 validation)

For the hedgehog ansatz `Q0 = exp(θ Gz)·exp(φ Gy)·exp(ψ Gx)` with `φ=atan2(y,x)`,
`θ=atan2(√(x²+y²), z)`, and phase `ψ = ψ(t,x,y,z)`, the twist equation reduces to:

```text
2 ∂_tt ψ = [ (∇ − Â^hedg)²  +  (Â^hedg·∇ / ‖Â^hedg‖)² ] ψ          Klein–Gordon-like

    Â^hedg(x,y,z) = (x, y, z) / r²,     r = √(x²+y²+z²)
    dual: Ψ = exp(iψ),  Klein–Gordon clock at E = mc² → ω = mc²/ℏ (Zitterbewegung)
```

The other two (tilt) equations are satisfied identically (`= 0`) → they are the Maxwell
sector. **This is the M5.5.1 validation target** (reproduce it from Eq.35) and the **M5.6
implementation target** (KG emerges from twist, not added by hand).

### 5a. M5.6.1 findings (`sandbox_v5`, 2026-05-27) — the KG mass is GEOMETRIC, not a potential

Anatomy of the §5 operator, verified symbolically (`m5_6_1_kg_operator_check.py`) and
numerically (`m5_6_1b_twist_evolution.py`):

| Finding | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Hedgehog connection identities** | `∇·Â = 1/r²` and `‖Â‖² = 1/r²` (sympy). |
| **Explicit mass term CANCELS** | `(∇−Â)²ψ = ∇²ψ − (∇·Â)ψ − 2Â·∇ψ + ‖Â‖²ψ`; the zeroth-order coeff `−(∇·Â)+‖Â‖² = 0` **exactly**. The full operator reduces to `L = 2∂_rr + (1/r²)Δ_Ω` (checked on `r⁴`, `cos r`, `e^{−r}`). **Bare phase ψ is MASSLESS** (numeric: residual `→0` as dx→0). |
| **Mass is geometric, lives in `Ψ=e^{iψ}`** | The KG mass is minimal coupling to the connection `Â` (the `k→k−Â` shift), **NOT** an added `V_ψ`. `‖Â‖²=1/r²` survives as a position-dependent mass² only in the dual complex field via `(∇−iÂ)²Ψ`. This is the literal statement of *"KG from twist, not from V"* — and pinpoints the **M5.2 error** (we added mass to a potential; the mass was always in the geometry). |
| **Regularization GENERATES the finite mass** | With a core-regularized `Â = x/(r²+r_c²)`, the cancellation no longer holds: `−(∇·Â)+‖Â‖² = −3r_c²/(r²+r_c²)²` (numeric matches analytic to 5%). ⇒ emergent **mass²(r) = 3r_c²/(2(r²+r_c²)²)** — scale `~1/r_c²` at the core, `→0` far out. The particle mass is *set by the core regularization* (why Faber/M5.6.3 is load-bearing for lepton masses/M5.9). A uniform ψ then oscillates (bounded, real `+`mass²). |
| **Natural conserved measure is `1/r²`-weighted** | `L = 2∂_rr + (1/r²)Δ_Ω` is self-adjoint w.r.t. `dμ = d³x/r²`, not flat `d³x`. Numeric: flat-measure energy drifts 190% on a twist packet, the `1/r²`-weighted energy drifts 6%. Carry this measure into the M5.6.2 core treatment. |
| **Physical field = covariant gradient `(∇ψ−Â)`** | A phase that winds with the connection (`∇ψ ≈ Â`, e.g. `ψ=½ln(r²+r_c²)`) has `‖∇ψ−Â‖/‖∇ψ‖ ≈ 1.5e-3` — the gauge-invariant `(∇ψ−Â)` is the physical observable (the massless vacuum), not bare `∇ψ`. |

**Consequence for M5.6.2/.3:** the core treatment isn't just numerical hygiene — it *creates*
the mass. M5.6.2 handles the disclination + core on the `1/r²` measure; M5.6.3 (Faber) replaces
the ad-hoc `r_c` with the physical running-coupling scale that pins the lepton mass.

### 5b. M5.6.2a findings (`sandbox_v5/m5_6_2a_biaxial_hedgehog.py`, 2026-05-27) — `C_μν` is the matrix-level mass source

The scalar result (§5a) has a matrix-field counterpart on the **biaxial hedgehog** frame
`O = [r̂ | e_Θ | e_Φ]`, `D = diag(1, δ, 0)` (eigenvalue-1 axis radial; δ-twist + null axes
in the tangent plane). Verified numerically:

| Finding | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Frame structure** | `O` orthonormal in the bulk (`‖O^TO−I‖=4e-13`, det=+1); `M_bg=ODO^T` recovers eigenvalues `(1, δ, 0)`; principal director · r̂ = 1.0000. |
| **`C_μν = [M_μ^bg, M_ν^bg] ≠ 0`** | the background curvature is **nonzero** — the gauge source of the mass. **Contrast M5.5.2**: the single-generator bump `O=Ry(γ)` has `C_μν ≡ 0` (one generator commutes with its own derivatives) → no mass, which is exactly why M5.5.2 was massless. Biaxiality (multiple generators rotating across space) is what turns the mass on. |
| **`‖C‖ ∝ r^(−1.96)`** | the matrix curvature scales as **`1/r²`** — the same profile as §5a's scalar geometric mass `‖Â‖²=1/r²`. Two independent routes (scalar twist operator + matrix background curvature) give the same position-dependent mass. `C_μν` IS the matrix-level realization of the geometric KG mass. |
| **z-axis disclination** | biaxiality forces a hairy-ball line singularity on the z-axis (`e_Φ` winds). Regularized by a clamped smoothstep: the secondary `(δ, 0)` axes are full-length for `ρ ≥ ρ_c` (exact hedgehog) and **melt smoothly to 0 inside `ρ < ρ_c`** (biaxiality melts in the disclination core, like a nematic). Frame stays orthonormal outside the core; `‖∂O‖²` peak is **capped `∝ 1/ρ_c`** (sweep: `24→9.3→4.9` for `ρ_c = 0.4/0.8/1.2`). |

**M5.6.2b — dynamical confirmation** (`sandbox_v5/m5_6_2b_biaxial_evolution.py`): running the
validated M5.5.2 leapfrog (`2K ψ_tt = Σ_μ ∂_μ J_μ`, `J_μ=−32Σ_ν F̃_μν•P_ν`) on the biaxial
hedgehog, disclination-masked:

| Result | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **`C_μν` SOURCES the twist** | The `C_μν` piece of `J_μ` is a ψ-independent source `S_μ=−32Σ_ν C_μν•P_ν`. At ψ=0: `max\|force\|` = **0.74 with `C_μν`, exactly 0.000 with `C=0`**; from ψ=0 the twist grows to 0.127 with `C` and stays **0.000** without. The biaxial hedgehog cannot sit static at ψ=0 — it drives its own twist. |
| **restoring / mass** | a seeded twist grows then oscillates around a balance (bounded, `0.12→0.22→0.17`); the massless M5.5.2 bump (`C=0`) had no restoring force. The mass scale tracks `‖C‖ ~ 1/r²`. |
| **conservation** | the FULL Hamiltonian `H=Σ(Kψ_t²+U)` drifts **0.76%** over 1500 steps (conservative). The ψ-sector energy grows +131% — NOT a drift: it's the `C`-drive pumping energy from the background curvature into the twist. (0.76% is non-tiny because the system is driven + disclination-masked; some leakage at the active-region Dirichlet boundary.) |

**Interpretation (flagged, not claimed):** `C_μν≠0` ⇒ ψ=0 is not a static solution ⇒ the defect
intrinsically oscillates. This is the *no-static-soliton / time-periodic* principle made dynamical
([[feedback_no_static_solitons]]) and is the plausible **M5.8 Zitterbewegung-clock seed** — the
clock *frequency* (`ω=2mc²/ℏ`) is M5.8's measurement, after M5.6.3 (Faber) pins the mass scale.

### 5c. M5.6.3a findings (`sandbox_v5/m5_6_3a_faber_regularization.py`, 2026-05-27) — Faber's regularization pins the mass scale

Faber's *Model of Topological Fermions* (Faber & Golubich, *Universe* 11/2025/113) gives the
**physical** regularization that sets the mass scale M5.6.1/.2 left as an ad-hoc `r_c`. Ported
natively (per [[reference_faber_regularization]], "port don't reinvent"):

| Faber (his Eq.) | Mapping / result |
| --- | --- |
| Field `Q = q₀ − iσ·q⃗`, unit 4-vector on S³ (`q₀=cos α`, `q⃗=n̂ sin α`) | the SU(2)/SO(3) twist field; `α` = rotation angle, `n̂` = orientation |
| **Regularization potential `Λ = q₀⁶/r₀⁴`** (Eq.4) | depends on `q₀=cos α`, i.e. the order-parameter **amplitude** `‖q⃗‖=sin α` — **not** the rotation direction. Consistent with the M5.5.3 finding that `V(M)` is rotation-invariant (acts on the eigenvalue/amplitude sector only). |
| Soliton `n̂=x̂`, `α=arctan(r/r₀)` ⇒ `q⃗ = x⃗/√(r₀²+r²)` | `‖q⃗‖→0` at the core (radial vector shrinks) — **identical to the M5.6.2a disclination/core melt**. Faber independently validates that core handling. |
| **Rest energy `E₀ = α_f ℏc · π/(4r₀)`** (Eq.8) | reproduced numerically (units `α_f ℏc=1`): `E₀ → π/4` as N↑ (**4.6% at N=181**, finite-difference + box-truncation limited); **`E₀·r₀` exactly constant (CV 0.0%) ⇒ `E₀ ∝ 1/r₀`**. |
| Physical anchor: `r₀ = 2.2132 fm` (= `π/4 ×` classical e⁻ radius) | `⇒ E₀ = 0.511 MeV` (electron). The regularization radius `r₀` IS the mass knob. |

**The deliverable:** the mass scale is no longer an ad-hoc `r_c` — it's `r₀`, fixed by the `Λ=q₀⁶/r₀⁴`
potential and tied to `α_f` + the mass via `E₀ ∝ 1/r₀`. This is the M5.9 lepton-mass-calibration handle.

**M5.6.3b — Faber's `Λ` mapped onto Duda's M** (`sandbox_v5/m5_6_3b_faber_on_M.py`): the
amplitude mapping is realized by spatially-melting eigenvalues. With `s(r)=sin α=r/√(r₀²+r²)`,
`D(s) = D_iso + s·(D_full − D_iso)` (`D_full=diag(1,δ,0)`, `D_iso=(1+δ)/3·I`), `M = O·D(s)·O^T`:

| Result | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| amplitude = eigenvalue spread | `mean\|spread − s(r)\| = 8e-16` — the melt makes M's eigenvalue spread *exactly* `s(r)`, →0 at the core. |
| both singularities melt | `M→scalar·I` at the core ⇒ point core **and** z-axis disclination regularized together; curvature energy `∫‖[M_μ,M_ν]‖²` drops **67%** vs the rigid `D_full` and is finite. |
| mass pinned `E ∝ 1/r₀` | `E·r₀` constant across `r₀` — Faber's `E₀∝1/r₀` reproduced on Duda's matrix substrate. |

**Caveat (honest):** `E·r₀` is *exactly* constant because the construction imposes Faber's
scale-covariant profile (`s=r/√(r₀²+r²)`, box `∝r₀`) rather than dynamically minimizing — so
`E∝1/r₀` is analytic for that profile, exactly as in Faber's own setup (he imposes `α=arctan(r/r₀)`).
This confirms the **M-framework reproduces Faber's scaling**; independently re-deriving the profile
via energy minimization is an M5.9-calibration BVP, not done here.

## 6. Matrix Hamiltonian (Eq.23) — the M5.4-carry-over `compute_energyH_density`

```text
ℋ = Σ_{0≤μ<ν} ‖F_μν‖²_F  +  V(M)  +  Σ_μ F_{0μ}•∂_μA_0
```

The last term vanishes in vacuum (integration by parts, as in EM). This replaces the M5.4
placeholder `compute_energyH_density` (which reads the dormant ψ buffer → uniform `¼λ`) and
gets the deferred physical-energy-scaling factor. Lands with the matrix leapfrog in the
launcher's `compute_propagation` no-op.

The authoritative symbolic derivation lives in Duda's GitHub

| 5.5.4 ✅ | **Taichi port** done. `engine2_pde`: `compute_curvature_flux` (G_α=8Σ[[M_α,M_ν],M_ν]) + `evolve_M` (leapfrog) + `V_M`/`dV_M`; `medium`: `curv_flux_*` + `swap_matrix_buffers`; `engine3`: `compute_energyH_density_M`; launcher: `compute_propagation` → matrix leapfrog + `eigen_decompose` (Evolve PDE LIVE), `compute_energyH_density_M` (WAVE_MENU=4 = matrix ℋ). **Energy-conserving** (`m5_5_4_matrix_evolution_check.py`: secular drift 2.15%→1.13%→0.03% as dt→0 = symplectic; the flat 6% osc is the velocity-measurement convention). Integrated path verified (M+director evolve). **Resolves both M5.4 carry-overs.** | e_scale=1 (bare); physical-energy calibration tied to a reference mass → M5.9. Production-scale dynamics speed via SIM_SPEED/c_amrs. **On-screen VERIFIED (Rodrigo 2026-05-26) — "bounded-not-bug"**: a hedgehog under "Evolve PDE" *sloshes* (not the old explode-and-propagate wave); a headless mirror of the GUI scenario (63³, dx≈15.2, V off, 1200 steps) holds **H conserved to 5 digits** with `max‖M−D‖_F` bounded `0.7→2.2→1.6`, finite — correct nonlinear curvature dynamics, NOT a blow-up. The wave-propagation look belonged to the retired *linear* ψ leapfrog. |

**Exit criterion (M5.5):** the full Eq.18 action runs; defect dynamics are governed by the
real proposed action (not the M5.1 Frank-energy approximation); KG emerges from the twist mode.

## 9. M5.5.2 evolution — EOM derivation + the kinetic-degeneracy finding

**Kinetic term (derived 2026-05-26, confirmed by Rodrigo).** The "electric"/time curvature
parallels Eq.20:

```text
A_0 = [M, Ṁ]                                       (Ṁ = ∂_0 M)
F_μ0 = ∂_μA_0 − ∂_0A_μ = 2[M_μ, Ṁ]                 (the [M,·] terms cancel: ∂_μṀ = ∂_0∂_μM)
```

So the action splits into a proper kinetic + potential:

```text
ℒ = T − U
T = Σ_{μ=1..3} ‖F_μ0‖²_F = 4 Σ_μ ‖[M_μ, Ṁ]‖²_F            kinetic (quadratic in Ṁ)
U = Σ_{μ<ν} ‖F_μν‖²_F + V(M) = 4 Σ_{μ<ν} ‖[M_μ,M_ν]‖²_F + V(M)
EOM:  ∂_0(∂T/∂Ṁ) = ∂T/∂M − ∂U/∂M
```

`M`, `M_μ`, `Ṁ` are all real-symmetric → `[M_μ,Ṁ]` is antisymmetric; `T ≥ 0`.

**THE FINDING — the kinetic metric is DEGENERATE (gauge structure):** `T = 4Σ_μ‖[M_μ,Ṁ]‖²`
vanishes whenever `Ṁ` commutes with every spatial gradient `M_μ`. Consequences that shape
M5.5.2:

| Implication | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Evolve the rotation DoF, not M's 6 components | The dynamical variable is `O(x) ∈ SO(3)` (3 angles/voxel; `D` frozen). `M`'s 6 free components include gauge/non-dynamical directions — a naive leapfrog on `M` hits the degenerate (non-invertible) metric. Parameterize by `O` (or angular velocity `ω = OᵀȮ`). |
| The twist is dynamical ONLY on a non-uniform director background | A pure single-axis twist `M=Rx(ψ)D Rx(ψ)ᵀ` has `M_x ∝ M'` and `Ṁ ∝ M'` → `[M_x,Ṁ]=0` → **T=0**. So a uniform-axis 1D twist is in the kinetic null space (NOT dynamical). The KG-for-twist emerges only when the twist couples to a position-dependent director — i.e. the **hedgehog**. |
| Minimal KG test is inherently 3D hedgehog + twist | This is exactly the Fig.9 case (twist phase `ψ(t,x,y,z)` on the hedgehog → KG with `Â^hedg`). So M5.5.2's KG-dispersion validation converges with M5.6's headline. |

**Refined M5.5.2 plan:** evolve `O(x) ∈ SO(3)` (gauge-clean DoF) on a small 3D grid, with the
hedgehog as the background + a small twist-phase perturbation; the field-dependent kinetic
metric `T = 4Σ‖[M_μ,Ṁ]‖²` is non-degenerate on the rotation DoF. Validate Eq.23 energy
conservation + KG dispersion `ω(k)` of the twist. (Static Coulomb already validated via the
M5.4 page-18 energy = `¼Σ‖F_μν‖²`.) This is a substantial numerical build — the M5.5↔M5.6 core.
