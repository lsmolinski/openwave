# M4.10: Mutual Consistency of Newtonian Force from EMC Field Overlap

## Abstract
This artifact verifies the mutual mathematical and physical consistency of the EMC push-out mechanism with Newton's gravitational force law, using the self-consistent geometric trinity $G_{\text{geom}}, \hbar_{\text{geom}}, \lambda_l$ derived from the BCC lattice in the M4.7 emergence engine. By integrating the field overlap of two density deficits over space, the framework demonstrates that the interaction energy yields an inverse-square force law consistent with Newtonian dynamics, with the circularity half of the strength clause discharged and the accuracy half stated.

## Geometric G from the Self-Consistent Trinity

The monopole amplitude $A$ and the EMC coupling $K_{\text{emc}}$ are both built from $G_{\text{geom}}$, derived from the BCC lattice:

$$G_{\text{geom}} = \frac{G_{\text{Base}}}{A_\pi} \left( \frac{1}{N_{\text{geom}} A_\pi} \right)^3 \frac{1}{K_{WC} \sqrt{N_{\nu,\text{eff}}}}$$

At $N_{\text{geom}} = 778.8025$:

- $G_{\text{geom}} = 6.677519975508460 \times 10^{-11}\ \text{m}^3\,\text{kg}^{-1}\,\text{s}^{-2}$
- $\lambda_l$ (derived) $= 1.616646406608278 \times 10^{-35}\ \text{m}$

**Accuracy statement.** Circularity is discharged; accuracy is stated and not met. Circularity: $G_{\text{geom}}$ enters the force test directly, derived from BCC geometry, without re-entering through an input. Accuracy: the $G_{\text{geom}}$ residual against CODATA is $0.048169\%$, or $21.9\times$ the CODATA 2022 relative uncertainty on $G$ (22 ppm). At that distance the derived value does not agree with the measured $G$ within its uncertainty. The dimensional anchors $r_e, m_e, c$ are the measured quantities used to build the dimensionless geometric ratio; the derivation produces $G_{\text{geom}}$ as a dimensionless ratio against $c^2 r_e / m_e$, not $G$ from nothing.

## Angular Integral Correction & Field Overlap Formulation
The 3D volumetric interaction energy between two displaced monopole deficits $\delta\eta_1 = -A_1/r_1$ and $\delta\eta_2 = -A_2/r_2$ separated by distance $R$ reduces via angular integration to:

$$\int d\Omega \frac{r - R \cos\theta}{\left(r^2 + R^2 - 2rR \cos\theta\right)^{3/2}} = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{for } r < R \\ \frac{4\pi}{r^2} & \text{for } r \ge R \end{cases}$$

The total geometric overlap integral $I(R)$ is evaluated over the spatial domain $r \in [R, \infty)$:

$$I(R) = \int \nabla \delta\eta_1 \cdot \nabla \delta\eta_2 \, dV = A_1 A_2 \int_{R}^{\infty} \frac{4\pi}{r^2} \, dr = \frac{4\pi A_1 A_2}{R}$$

Differentiating with respect to $R$ gives the geometric gradient magnitude:

$$F_{\text{geom}} = -\frac{dI}{dR} = \frac{4\pi A_1 A_2}{R^2}$$

*(Note: $F_{\text{geom}}$ is a purely geometric intermediate gradient magnitude, superseded by the physical field-energy force $F_{\text{EMC}}$ in the next section.)*

## Physical Interaction Energy and Sign Convention

The physical interaction energy $U_{\text{int}}(R)$ follows from the negative-definite field energy functional $E[\delta\eta]$ of the overlapping EMC deficits, serving as the exact field-theoretic analogue of the negative Newtonian field energy $-\frac{1}{8\pi G}\int |\nabla\Phi|^2 dV$:

$$
E[\delta\eta] = -\frac{1}{2} K_{\text{emc}} \int |\nabla \delta\eta|^2 \, dV
$$

For two superposed monopole deficits $\delta\eta = \delta\eta_1 + \delta\eta_2$ the two self-energy terms are independent of $R$, so the interaction energy is the cross term of $E$:

$$
U_{\text{int}}(R) = -\frac{1}{2} K_{\text{emc}} \cdot 2 \int \nabla \delta\eta_1 \cdot \nabla \delta\eta_2 \, dV = -K_{\text{emc}} I(R) = -\frac{4\pi K_{\text{emc}} A_1 A_2}{R}
$$

The minus sign is therefore derived from the energy functional, not imposed by hand.

Differentiating with respect to $R$ defines the attractive physical force $F_{\text{EMC}}$:

$$
F_{\text{EMC}} = -\frac{dU_{\text{int}}}{dR} = -\frac{4\pi K_{\text{emc}} A_1 A_2}{R^2}
$$

which is strictly attractive ($F_{\text{EMC}} < 0$ pointing inward towards decreasing $R$). The shipped script reports magnitudes only; the sign is carried by the energy functional.

Coupling this to the EMC pressure constant $K_{\text{emc}} = \frac{c^4}{16\pi G_{\text{geom}}}$ and substituting the monopole amplitudes $A_i = \frac{2 G_{\text{geom}} M_i}{c^2}$ yields:

$$
F_{\text{EMC}} = -\frac{G_{\text{geom}} M_1 M_2}{R^2}
$$

which matches the attractive Newtonian force $F_{\text{Newton}}$.

## Structural Discrimination Analysis
Because $G_{\text{geom}}$ enters both $A$ and $K_{\text{emc}}$, it cancels identically in $F_{\text{EMC}} \equiv F_{\text{Newton}}$, exactly as $G$ did: the gate passes for any value of $G_{\text{geom}}$ and remains a normalization-consistency gate on $A$, $K_{\text{emc}}$ and $4\pi$, not a test of $G_{\text{geom}}$. Mutating any single normalization factor breaks the agreement:

| Parameter Mutation | Observed Rel. Diff. | Gate Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Baseline (Shipped) | $1.203 \times 10^{-5}\%$ | **PASS** |
| Angular Factor ($4\pi \to 3\pi$) | $25.0\%$ | **FAIL** |
| Monopole Amplitude ($2GM/c^2 \to GM/c^2$) | $75.0\%$ | **FAIL** |
| Coupling Denominator ($16\pi \to 8\pi$) | $100.0\%$ | **FAIL** |

## Precision Note
The residual of $\sim 1.203 \times 10^{-5}\%$ reported under the coordinate mapping $r(t) = \frac{R}{1-t}$ is due to accumulated floating-point roundoff from midpoint summation over a constant transformed integrand $\frac{4\pi}{R}$, rather than a physical error.
