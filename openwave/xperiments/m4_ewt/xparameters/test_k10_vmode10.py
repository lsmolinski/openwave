XPERIMENT PARAMETERS

Progressive particle formation test.
Verifies prediction: K=2..9 are UNSTABLE (decay/fly apart),
K=10 is the first stable standalone particle (electron tetrahedron).

Switch K below. Positions come from xparameters/utils/geometry.py, which
dispatches on K:
  K=10:  the 1-3-6 tetrahedron (the electron)
  K=11:  a golden-angle (Fibonacci) sphere
  other: the golden-angle fallback, every point on a sphere of radius 0.35 lambda

Spacing note, MEASURED (all 45 pair separations, univ_edge = 1e-15, in units of
lambda). An earlier version of this note claimed only K=10 sits at the lock-in
wells r = n*lambda; that was written without measuring and is backwards:

  K=2..4    every pair exactly 1.000              fully at the first well
  K=5..9    0.76 to 1.73, some pairs on wells     golden-angle fallback
  K=10      0.701 to 3.336, NO pair on a well     the 1-3-6 tetrahedron
  K=11      0.326 to 0.698, NO pair on a well     golden-angle sphere

So K=10 is currently the case furthest from lock-in spacing, not the closest,
and the 0.33-0.70 lambda band the old note attributed to K=2..9 is really K=11's.

Two consequences worth knowing before reading a K=10 run as a lock-in result:
tetrahedron_10 in utils/geometry.py sets its radii as normalized constants
(r1 = 0.02, r2 = 0.04) instead of deriving them from LOCK_SPACING, so (a) none of
its separations land on a well, and (b) the geometry does not scale with
UNIVERSE_EDGE, so at 2e-15 every number above doubles in units of lambda. Which
radii the 1-3-6 electron should use is the model author's call and is being
explored across the electron_k*_vmode10_* xparameters; this note only records
what the shipped generator currently does.

Reproduce: generate_positions_by_EWT_geometry(1e-15, K, center=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
rotation=(0, 0, 0), perturbation=0.0), then take math.dist over every pair and
divide by constants.EWAVE_LENGTH / 1e-15.

The named geometries this file used to build (line, triangle, tetrahedron,
bipyramid, octahedron, cube, tricapped prism) are no longer generated.
