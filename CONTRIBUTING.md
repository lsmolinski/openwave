## Getting Started

- **Fork the Repository**  
  - Click “Fork” on GitHub to create your own copy.

- **Clone Your Fork**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/openwave.git
   cd openwave
   ```

- **Set Up the Environment & Install**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
  # Option 1: via Venv
    python -m venv openwave
    source openwave/bin/activate  # On Windows: openwave\Scripts\activate
   
  # Option 2: via Conda (recommended)
    conda create -n openwave python=3.12
    conda activate openwave

# Install OpenWave & Dependencies for Development (-e = edit mode)
   pip install -e .  # installs dependencies from pyproject.toml
   ```

- **Create a Branch to Develop Your Feature**

```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```

- Optional: LaTex & FFmpeg (video generation)

```bash
# Install LaTeX and FFmpeg (macOS)
   brew install --cask mactex-no-gui ffmpeg
   echo 'export PATH="/Library/TeX/texbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   exec zsh -l

# Verify LaTeX installation
   which latex && latex --version
   which dvisvgm && dvisvgm --version
   which gs && gs --version
```

## Code Style & Quality

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for formatting.
- Run tests before committing:

```python
  pytest
  ```

---

## Submitting Your Changes

- Commit with a clear, descriptive message.
- Push your branch to your fork:

```python
   git push origin your-feature-name
   ```

- Open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub.
- Be ready to discuss and revise your PR after review.

## Sign-Off — Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

OpenWave uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) v1.1](https://developercertificate.org/) instead of a Contributor License Agreement. Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by:` line certifying you wrote the patch (or otherwise have the right to contribute it) under the project's license.

Add the sign-off automatically with the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your commit message"
```

This appends a line like:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### Optional: auto-sign every commit via a local hook

To avoid having to remember `-s` (and to add sign-off automatically when committing from GUIs like GitHub Desktop), the repo ships a `prepare-commit-msg` hook in [`.githooks/`](./.githooks/). Activate it in your clone with a one-time command:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This is a per-clone setting — run it once after cloning. Verify with:

```bash
git config --get core.hooksPath  # should print: .githooks
```

The hook reads your `git config user.name` and `user.email` and appends the `Signed-off-by:` line automatically on every commit. It is idempotent and skips merge / squash commits.

By signing off, you certify the full text of the DCO v1.1:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by you, and you have the right to submit it under the open-source license indicated in the file.
1. The contribution is based upon previous work that is covered under an appropriate open-source license, and you have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications.
1. The contribution was provided directly to you by some other person who certified (1) or (2), and you have not modified it.
1. You understand and agree that the project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information you submit with it) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open-source license(s) involved.
